        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is bringing another PlayStation exclusive to PC. Sackboy: A Big Adventure is set to release on PC on October 27th, according to a trailer that was posted early to Sony’s PlayStation Latin America YouTube account. Spotted by Nibel on Twitter, the trailer confirms the PC port of Sackboy: A Big Adventure will be full of improvements.
4K and 120fps support is listed, alongside support for ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio monitors, Nvidia’s DLSS, and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). These are the best improvements to Sackboy: A Big Adventure yet, following a resolution and visuals boost on the PS5 version.
Sackboy is the latest in a line of PlayStation games on PC
Sackboy: A Big Adventure is the latest in a growing line of PlayStation exclusive games on PC. Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launched on PC last month, after Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, and God of War appeared in recent years. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is also launching on PC on October 19th, with Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales arriving on PC at some point this fall.
Sony has been increasingly focused on PlayStation PC ports, and wants around half of its games to be on PC and mobile by 2025. Sony even started using a PlayStation PC label last year alongside acquiring a PC port developer.
The announcement of Sackboy: A Big Adventure on PC comes just a day after a PC version of the Returnal settings menu leaked. Sony confirmed its authenticity by copyright striking the video on YouTube, but the settings video showed support for ray-traced shadows and reflections, and Nvidia’s DLSS. Sony might also be working on its own PlayStation PC launcher, as references to the launcher were discovered in the recent release of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC.]]></summary>

 Democrats have been working for months to nail down legislation that would make it harder for members of Congress to use information they receive on the job for their own financial gain, following a string of instances over the last few years in which they appear to have done just that.

This means the Horizon is just a cosmetic change accompanying the old “heritage” design, and it comes in the same original gold, stealth, black, and silver finis…]]></summary>

But we do know that Hertz is working with BP Pulse, the oil giant’s EV branch, to build out “a network of fast-charging hubs” with the goal of serving both Hertz customers and everyday EV drivers.

No more using glitches to pull off your designs
 Genshin Impact is more than just an open-world exploration game. In addition to sweeping quests across its massive map, the game also lets you decorate buildings, plants, landmarks and more, in a separate realm called the Serenitea Pot (also known as the Realm Within). It’s a detailed decorating simulator, and a change introduced in the 3.1 patch made it even better by allowing players to overlap decorations. 
The seemingly small change makes a big impact for fans who are super into decorating since it allows for more flexibility. Before this patch, items could not be placed closed together, and instead required a varying amounts of space as a buffer. To get around this, fans had to exploit a shaking glitch where they would wiggle around decorations before placing. The glitch would allow players to place the items within the radius of other decorations. Now, that’s no longer an issue, and players can decorate to their heart’s content. 
  @tikolatte 
Shaking glitch is no more! #sereniteapot #genshinteleport #hoyoversecreators 
 ♬ End Of Line but better - MothMom • Dingus 
  

Genshin Impact has loads of different options for players — some people focus on exploration, others focus on building strong characters, and some focus almost exclusively on decorating their teapot. Known in the community as “teapot mains,” this group of players almost immediately picked up on the change. Now, it’ll be a lot easier for hardcore decorators and casual designers alike to design the Genshin Impact realm of their dreams.]]></summary>

How Hurricane Ian got so powerful — in just two days.
 On Monday morning, Hurricane Ian had wind speeds of 75 miles per hour. Just 48 hours later, those speeds had more than doubled. On Wednesday, as the storm made landfall in southwestern Florida, Ian’s wind hit 155 mph — just shy of a Category 5 storm, the most severe category for a hurricane.
Such rapid growth is known by meteorologists as “rapid intensification.” It’s defined as storms whose wind speeds increase by roughly 35 mph or more in less than 24 hours. “Ian definitely met that criteria,” said Paul Miller, a professor of oc…]]></summary>

Google will finally be sharing more about the Pixel 7 and Pixel Watch at its next Made by Google event
 Google is hosting its next Made by Google launch event on October 6th, where it plans to announce details about the Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel Watch, and new devices from Nest. There will be an in-person event happening in New York City, but the company is also livestreaming the show from its Made by Google YouTube channel.
Google has already revealed the designs of the smartphones and the Pixel Watch, so we expect that the company will share a lot more about what’s under the hood for those devices (like the new Tensor chip for the Pixel phones) as well as any new software features. What’s coming for Nest is a bit more of a mystery, but leaks indicate that one product we might see is a new Nest Wifi Pro.
Catch up with all of our coverage of what’s coming and what’s announced right here. The event kicks off at 10AM ET on October 6th.]]></summary>

Sony’s new PlayStation Stars loyalty program will launch in North and South America on October 5th, the company announced on Wednesday. The new program will let PlayStation fans earn rewards like points and digital collectibles by doing things like playing a game or earning certain trophies. 
Sony has also spelled out some of the finer details of the program, which broadly line up with information we’ve heard before. The service is free to join with an adult PlayStation Network account, and while players can earn some benefits if they are a PlayStation Plus member, you don’t need to subscribe to PlayStation Plus to join Stars. The “full PlayStation Stars experience” will be available via the PlayStation mobile app but not consoles to start; Sony said in September that Stars would expand to consoles “in the future.” 
Some collectibles will be “ultra-rare,” but don’t worry, they’re not NFTs
You’ll be able to earn both loyalty points and digital collectibles via PlayStation Stars. Points will be able to be redeemed for things like PSN funds and certain PlayStation Store items. The collectibles will include things like digital versions of characters and devices from PlayStation’s history, and you’ll be able to display them in a case in the PlayStation app.
Some of the collectibles will be “ultra-rare”; while it’s unclear exactly what it will take to get those, Sony’s blog post says that being the first to get a platinum trophy in certain games as one Stars campaign that’s in the works. But the company stresses that the collectibles are not one of a kind, do not “leverage blockchain technology,” and can’t be resold or traded, so these won’t be PlayStation NFTs, thank goodness. 
PlayStation Stars is beginning to roll out now in Asia (including Japan) and will launch in Europe and Australia on October 13th.]]></summary>

Instagram says it’s permanently removed the official account for Pornhub for violating policies multiple times, Instagram’s parent company, Meta, told Motherboard. 
Meta claims that, over the past decade, Pornhub has repeatedly violated its terms of service regarding nudity, adult content, and sexual solicitation. However, it did not specify how exactly beyond telling the New York Post that the account recently violated rules against sexual solicitation by encouraging Instagram users to leave the social media platform and visit a porn site. Meta adds the adult entertainment company also violated guidelines concerning multiple violations of its terms.
In response, Pornhub published an open letter on Twitter, calling the move unfai…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Verge
    

  
Starting “early next year,” Google will be able to notify you if your personal info, such as your phone number, email, or home address, shows up in search results as part of its “results about you” tool. The announcement comes as Google has officially started rolling out the tool, which lets people easily create takedown requests for results with their personal info. The tool started showing up for some people last week.
In a tweet, the company says the notification system will be opt-in. Ideally, it’s not something that most people will have to turn on; however, it will be nice to have the option, especially for those in high-profile positions or who find themselves targeted by harassment campaigns. 


Early next year, you'll also be able to opt into alerts if new results appear with personally identifying information, so you can quickly request their removal from Google Search… pic.twitter.com/AFQy8bpAkX
— Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) September 28, 2022



It is worth noting, though, that Google is only taking down search results, not the content on the web itself. The information will still be on whatever site is hosting it but will just be harder for people to find.
Google has been letting people request that this sort of search result get taken down for a while now (and has had that ability for results that were intentional harassment or threats even longer), but it’s working to make the process significantly easier to access. The results about you tool lets you flag results with your personal info with a few button taps instead of having to find Google’s specific help article with the link to the form. 
It also gives you a place to track those requests. When notifications for it start rolling out next year, it’ll be even more powerful since you won't have to manually seek out the potentially harmful results to report them.]]></summary>

Verizon and the NFL go way back, and on Wednesday, the two groups announced their next new partnership: NFL Plus, the NFL’s new mobile streaming service, will be one of the streaming services offered on Plus Play, Verizon’s upcoming subscription management platform. 
Verizon first announced Plus Play in March, and to me, it sounds a lot like Apple’s Channels product. With Channels, you can subscribe to streaming services using your information and payment details linked to your Apple ID and manage those services from your Apple ID account instead of trying to remember a bunch of disparate logins. Plus Play seems to be Verizon’s take on a similar idea, but instead, you manage things via your Verizon account. Verizon has already said that partners like Netflix, Peloton, Disney Plus, and HBO Max are on board, and now we can count the NFL among them.
That said, Plus Play still isn’t widely available yet, so if you really wanted to manage your NFL Plus through the platform, you probably can’t. Plus Play is currently in “trials,” according to Wednesday’s press release, and is set to launch in early access “later this year.” 
For years, Verizon was the only place you could stream NFL games on a mobile phone, but that exclusivity ran out in 2017. Now, with NFL Plus, there’s once again a centralized spot to watch NFL games on your mobile phone, and you’ll soon be able to manage that service through Verizon. Teammates for life, I guess.]]></summary>

Microsoft confirmed that it’s removing SwiftKey from the Apple App Store and ending support for the iOS version of the keyboard app on October 5th. It will still be available if you’ve already downloaded SwiftKey on your iPhone, so long as you don’t uninstall it yourself.
“Microsoft will continue support for SwiftKey Android as well as the underlying technology that powers the Windows touch keyboard,” Chris Wolfe, the director of product management at SwiftKey, said in a statement to The Verge. “For those customers who have SwiftKey installed on iOS, it will continue to work until it is manually uninstalled or a user gets a new device.”
The move to discontinue SwiftKey on iOS comes after months of user complaints that seemingly went unresolved. On top of that, users noticed that Microsoft hasn’t updated the SwiftKey app on iOS in over a year, prompting suspicion over whether the app had been quietly discontinued. 
It remains unclear why Microsoft has decided to end support on iPhones. SwiftKey has been available on iOS since 2014, two years before Microsoft acquired the app. SwiftKey will still remain available and fully supported on Android, and Microsoft continues to roll out regular updates. Last year, SwiftKey brought clipboard syncing across Windows and Android devices that use the app but said it’s “not possible to sync your clips to iOS” at the time — and now we know why.]]></summary>

Mandatory, extensive overtime hurts workers, and OSHA may be able to regulate it
 Amber La Macchia was prepared to deal with crunch before she even joined the video game industry — it’s something she heard over and over again while studying game design in college just five years ago.
The practice of crunch — a word that games industry workers use to describe brutal overtime — is well-documented across multiple video game studios. You’d be hard-pressed to find a developer who hasn’t encountered it at least once. The industry has started to reckon with crunch, to better understand just how badly it hurts both workers and video games; studios like Rockstar Games, Activision Blizzard, CD Projekt Red, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga develop…]]></summary>

A prototype all-electric passenger plane took off for the first time yesterday in a test flight that marks a significant milestone for carbon pollution-free aviation. The nine-passenger commuter aircraft called Alice took off at 7:10AM yesterday from Washington state’s Grant County International Airport.
Alice is ahead of much of the pack when it comes to all-electric aircraft under development. It could become the “first all-new, all-electric commercial airplane” if the Federal Aviation Administration certifies it to carry passengers, The Seattle Times reports.

Get ready to lie, bluff, and star in a reality TV show
 The Jackbox Party Pack 9 is another entry in the Jackbox series of party games. Each pack comes with a few simple multiplayer games; players can join a Jackbox session using a browser on a computer or mobile device. These games are popular because they’re so easy to pick up and play with friends, and they make for excellent stream nights or social gatherings with pals. The Jackbox Party Pack 9 will be released on Oct. 20.
This pack comes with a sequel to a Jackbox classic, Fibbage 4. Fibbage, a game about suggesting fake trivia answers to puzzling questions, is one of the series’ most popular games. The pack also debuts four new games.
Quixort, a game with up to ten players, tasks participants with sorting falling answers into the proper categories on a factory floor. Quixort has a single-player mode for those who like trivia and/or Tetris.
Junktopia is for three to eight players, and it asks the players — who have been turned into frogs by a weird wizard — to create backstories for unusual, salvaged objects to be appraised for auction. The frog with the best backstories and most valuable items gets to be a human again. So, y’know, no pressure.
In Nonsensory, three to eight players have to come up with prompts in a drawing, writing, and guessing game. Players then rank each others’ creations on silly scales with subjective attributes.
The most elaborate-looking new game is Roomerang, a reality TV show with four to nine players. Contestants will respond to prompts and engage in role-play to avoid being voted out — although people who are booted can be Roomerang-ed back into the roster to stir up more nonsense.]]></summary>

The last FIFA game adds a lot of new features to the long-running franchise, but I was most excited about cosplaying as Jason Sudeikis and his mustache.
 There are a lot of reasons to be interested in FIFA 23. The latest soccer game from EA includes big features like the unfortunately belated addition of women’s pro leagues from France and England, alongside the return of Italian giants Juventus and general improvements to gameplay and visuals. More importantly, there’s also the nostalgia factor. The FIFA games have been around since the ’90s, and this will be the last entry with the FIFA branding. Starting in 2023, EA is calling its soccer games EA Sports FC. For me, though, my interest in FIFA 23 was something much more bas…]]></summary>

TikTok took down more than 113 million videos between April and June of this year, according to the company’s quarterly transparency report published today.
Though the number of videos the platform removed for policy violations is up slightly from the first few months of 2022, it’s just a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of content shared on TikTok. The 113 million represents just 1 percent of total videos uploaded during the three-month period.
The most common reason for removal was violating policies around minor safety, which accounted for just under 44 percent of videos taken down. Other common reasons include illegal activities and regulated goods, as well as adult nudity and sexual activities, according to the report.

Though Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem is one of the most fascinating and thought-provoking pieces of speculative fiction to come out in recent years, you wouldn’t know it judging from the way that Netflix has (barely) been talking about 3 Body Problem, its forthcoming adaptation of the novel from Alexander Woo, D.B. Weiss, and David Benioff
During this year’s Tudum, essentially all of Netflix’s larger profile projects due out in the coming months, like Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, and The Witcher’s third season, were spotlighted in segments that gave you a sense of what sort of energy their respective creative teams were working with.

Say you twisted your ankle on the trail, you’re out of cell signal range, and you need to call for help. Sounds like a great time to learn how to use a new feature on your phone, right? Hell no, and it seems that Apple has come to the same conclusion. Sleuths at 9to5Mac discovered some code in the latest iOS 16 developer beta that hints at the existence of a satellite SOS demo mode, potentially so you can get familiar with the feature before you get into trouble.
SOS via satellite is the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro-only feature Apple announced (and demo’d for us) earlier this month. It uses satellite connectivity to help relay messages and location info to emergency services when you’re out of cell range. It’s not live yet; the feature is expected to arrive in November. 


In the meantime, Apple seems to be laying the groundwork for its official launch. 9to5Mac found “multiple features” in iOS 16.1 developer beta 3 related to satellite connectivity, but the demo mode stands out as something we hadn’t heard about before. This satellite demo seems like a legitimate walkthrough, too, that requires you to go outside and find a clear view of the sky to use it. 9to5Mac reports that it will be available anytime from the settings menu.
Apple is far from alone in pursuing ways to connect phones to satellites, but it’s still a very new concept to most people. A demo mode could help iPhone 14 owners get familiar with the feature and how it works — or maybe help convince them that it’s worth paying for. Apple will include two years of service on the iPhone 14, but after that, it’s unclear how much it will cost.]]></summary>

Verizon is teasing that it’s working on a 5G gaming handheld with Razer and Qualcomm, which is set to be fully announced on October 15th at RazerCon. The carrier talked a little about the device, which will be called the Razer Edge 5G, at a keynote at MWC Las Vegas, saying that it’ll run Android and give you access to cloud gaming services like Xbox Cloud Gaming. Unlike devices like Logitech’s recently announced G Cloud, however, it does seem like it’ll be able to play games stored locally on the device as well.
While details are relatively sparse, we have heard of a similar device before: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon G3x Handheld Gaming Developer Kit. That device, which was shown off late last …]]></summary>

 10 years ago this week, Rian Johnson’s Looper burst into theaters with the sheer ventilating force of a blunderbuss shot.
The sci-fi action-thriller starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, which follows an assassin forced to fight a future version of himself, was a far cry from the director’s past films like Brick and The Brothers Bloom. Looper would amass such critical and commercial success that Johnson would be offered the opportunity to write and direct the second installment in Disney’s Star Wars sequel trilogy.
There are many things to admire when looking back on the production of Looper, like the film’s sobering depiction of a dilapidated Kansas City slouch…]]></summary>

The House is expected to vote on a package of previously uncontroversial bills targeting Big Tech’s market dominance this week, but a sudden flare-up among Republicans is threatening to hold up any movement on the bills. 
Earlier this week, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) announced that the House planned to vote on three bills that would make it more difficult and expensive for large tech companies, like Apple or Google, to acquire smaller companies by increasing filing fees. In turn, those fees would be used to fund investigations for federal antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department.

The internet is more visual and more interactive than ever. So how does the world’s biggest search engine change to fit the times? By redefining the whole idea.
 Google is trying to blow up how you think about search. To say it’s pivoting to compete in a world where TikTok and Instagram are changing the way the internet works would be an overstatement… but not a big one. Google now exists on a more visual, more interactive internet, in which users want to be surprised and delighted as often as they just want an answer to their questions. In that world, what is a search engine even for? The Google you see tomorrow might not be completely different, but the change is already starting.

Google wants its search engine to become the place where you do your online shopping. To do that, the company announced today that it’s introducing a set of new shopping-specific features meant to help you narrow down your results and — more importantly — keep you on Google.
For starters, Google’s folding shopping features directly into its main search bar, no longer requiring you to hit the “Shopping” tab whenever you’re searching for something you want to buy. Starting your searches with the word “shop” followed by a product name will automatically yield a set of visual results and research tools as well as availability in stores nearby.

Breaking it down Riker-style
 Trombone Champ is a delightfully silly game that asks players to match the beat with their snazzy trombone. It’s a game that immediately inspires fun gifs and clips; it’s just great to have your little cartoon avatar go absolutely ham on a trombone cover of the national anthem or the solo trombone version of a epic orchestral symphony. Rudeism, a streamer known for creating novelty controllers, has taken a crack at the ultimate Trombone Champ controller.


Here, we can see the controller in action: It’s a peripheral of an actual, factual trombone, complete with slide capabilities and some hearty doots. It’s not great as hearing the trombone serving as a proper instrument, but it is the most immersive way to rack up some Trombone Champ high scores.
BEHOLD, THE TROMBONE CONTROLLER
Ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting. If only I knew how to play it IRL  
The ultimate way to play Trombone Champ @HolyWowStudios pic.twitter.com/Lvm5m2CT44
— Rudeism (@rudeism) September 27, 2022



Rudeism made a short video of the trombone controller that shows how it works. An ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a built-in microphone captures his trumpet sounds. It’s absolutely beautiful. Rudeism has made a career out of gaming with these great peripherals, pulling off tricks like playing Rocket League with a guitar controller, playing as Overwatch’s French sniper Widowmaker with a controller baguette, and beating FromSoftware’s massive open world adventure Elden Ring with a Fisher Price controller.
Rudeism streams on Twitch, where you can catch his experimental stylings live. Sometimes he just relaxes with some Fall Guys, and sometimes he plays Untitled Goose Game in a giant goose suit. Variety is, after all, the spice of life.]]></summary>

Blink’s giving its blocky Mini security camera a new robot body. The new Mini Pan Tilt is a very literally named mounting accessory that converts your existing Blink Mini camera from a stationary device into a controllable camera that lets you look around the room.
Setup sounds like it’ll be easy for the Pan Tilt: you connect the Mini camera to the mount, plug in the Micro USB cord, and the camera now has 360-degree movement from the Blink app. You can even install it on a tripod or wall mount (not included), or you can just place it on a table.


You can preorder the Mini Pan Tilt mount today on Amazon for $29.99. There’s also a bundle that gets you the mount as well as a Blink Mini camera if you don’t have…]]></summary>

Since the start of the pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration has signed off on 430 COVID-19 tests through its emergency use authorization powers — rules that let the agency push tests and drugs out the door more quickly during an emergency. Now, over two years later, the agency is backing off that system and will treat most COVID-19 tests just like other medical tests. In a statement Tuesday, the FDA said that most new COVID-19 tests will have to go through the normal, non-emergency test review process. 
“For most new tests, shifting to traditional premarket review would best meet the public health needs at the current stage of the COVID-19 public health emergency,” said Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in the statement.
The emergency use authorization system lets the FDA review and authorize tests quickly, which was key during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when there weren’t nearly enough tests available to meet skyrocketing demand. It’s how we got the original tests that used deep nasal swabs to find the coronavirus, and it’s how all of the rapid at-home tests made it to drug store shelves. But now, there are plenty of COVID-19 tests available, the FDA said in its statement. There isn’t as much of a crush, so the agency can take more time reviewing new tests and give them full, formal approval. 
The United States is still under a federal public health emergency, so the FDA can still use the emergency use authorization process if it feels it needs to. In the statement, the agency said it will still use that process in a few cases — like for tests that use new technologies, or for tests that diagnose a new variant.
But for other COVID-19 tests, the process will go back to normal. It’s another signal that federal agencies are shifting to make COVID-19 part of the normal public health backdrop, rather than an acute emergency.]]></summary>

But Google has some ideas to help you discover the world around you in a far more immersive way, and it showed off some of what it’s working on at its Search On event on Wednesday.
One of those new features is what Google calls Immersive View, which it first demonstrated at this year’s Google I/O. On its face, it’s essentially a 3D aerial view of a certain area or location — think Apple Maps’ Flyover feature — but Immersive View also lets you go a level deeper by checking out weather, traffic, and even drill down to explore individual buildings.

AI software monitoring sounds from within bright yellow buoys could reduce whale deaths by identifying whale species and pod locations. Scientists then verify the data and relay that information to any ships passing nearby, helping them to avoid the animals. The Whale Safe project was launched by Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory and partners, with the first Whale Safe systems already deployed in the Santa Barbara Channel near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
Each buoy carries an onboard computer that records whale sounds using an underwater microphone. An AI algorithm then detects the clicks and squeals of specific whale speci…]]></summary>

The undersea explosions in two gas pipelines from Russia exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities — just as the continent faces a looming energy crisis.
 European and NATO officials are blaming sabotage for three leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 undersea pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. EU officials did not dd anyone directly, but the allegation underscored the uncertainty around Europe’s energy standoff with Russia, and how volatile the continent’s energy security is as winter approaches.

With multisearch, you can open up Google Lens in Google’s Android or iOS apps, snap a pic of the jacket, type out the color you want to find the jacket in, and search.

Amidst a slew of new hardware announcements today, Amazon is also announcing a host of new capabilities for Alexa, including a handful of new smart home features. The company hasn’t announced exact release dates for the updates, but its press release says it hopes to roll them out “over the coming months.”
It might sound like a small change, but one of the more significant upgrades is the ability to quickly and easily schedule smart home device actions for moments in the future. Although it’s previously been possible to schedule actions via the Alexa app, now the process is a lot simpler, thanks to voice commands like …]]></summary>

OpenAI has scrapped the wait list for access to its text-to-image system DALL-E 2, meaning anyone can sign up to use the AI art generator immediately.
The company unveiled the original DALL-E in January 2021, with the tool impressing both AI experts and the public with its ability to turn any text description (or prompt) into a unique image. Since then, a number of other text-to-image systems have been created that rival the speed and quality of DALL-E. Other systems, like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, are much easier for anyone to access, drawing attention away from OpenAI’s own offering.

Amazon’s first self-branded TV sets were aimed squarely at budget shoppers and prioritized value and good software over sheer picture quality. The Fire TV Omni lineup runs the same software as the company’s popular streaming device — offering access to endless entertainment apps — and the built-in microphones allow for hands-free Alexa voice commands. Today, Amazon is announcing the latest edition to its TV series, the Fire TV Omni QLED, and this time, it’s stepping up the display specs with the inclusion of full-array local dimming. 


Starting at $799.99 and coming in 65- and 75-inch ($1,099.99) sizes, the Fire TV Omni QLED includes “up to” 96 individual dimming zones…]]></summary>

Put Pigsy’s Noodle Tank in a Lego Movie sequel immediately 
 In the right hands, Lego sets are a form of storytelling. Whether following the prescribed on-the-box exploits of pirates, explorers, and starship captains or scrapping the instruction booklets to mix and match into genre-bending adventures, kids and adults alike have spent the last half-century constructing stories alongside their blocky structures. The artists involved with LEGO in Focus, a new photography book from Chronicle Books, take that form of play one step further.
For LEGO in Focus, 30 photographers from around the world grabbed their Lego minifigs to stage surreal setups that range from mundane scenes of everyday life to the microscopically fantastic. Polygon’s exclusive …]]></summary>

 SC Johnson’s administration building and research tower in Racine, Wisconsin, have become legendary as corporate headquarters buildings. 
As the above video shows, the administration building’s “Great Workroom” is a stunning example of architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s unique approach to office design. They were built ahead of their time, the precursor to corporate campuses like Apple Park and the Googleplex. 
But what did it really feel like? Vox’s Phil Edwards visited the headquarters to find out — and actually try to work there. First, he visited Wright’s nearby Hardy House, an earlier design that features many of the same Wright signatures found in the SC Johnson building, from custom-designed furniture to ideas about compression and expansion.
Watch our video to follow Phil and see what it really feels like to work in such a space.

The company’s annual September events are usually a marathon of new product launches. We’ll be covering the announcements live.
 Amazon has used its past September events to announce a flying camera drone, a home robot, and an Alexa-enabled microwave. Needless to say, it’s hard to predict what the company has in store at its annual event, but we can be certain there’ll be a lot of products on tap. Chances are high we’ll see updated devices in the Echo lineup, plenty of new things that work with Alexa, and likely some announcements involving other big Amazon brands too, from Fire TV to Ring and Eero.
The event is being held virtually via livestream, but it’s available to watch on an invite-only basis. If you want to keep up on the event as it happens, we’ve got you covered: The Verge staff will be tuned in and reporting from the event live, so you can stick around to be filled in as details are announced.
Amazon’s livestream starts today at 12PM ET / 9AM PT, and our live blog will kick off shortly before then. We can’t say for sure that we’ll get another gadget as glorious as the Alexa-powered Big Mouth Billy Bass, but you never really know what Amazon has in the works.

Square now lets merchants use Apple’s Tap to Pay feature to process transactions. In a press release, the company announced that sellers with a compatible iPhone can use Square’s Point of Sale (POS) app to accept contactless payments.
Apple first rolled out Tap to Pay on the iPhone XS and newer in February. The feature transforms the iPhone into a contactless payment terminal, letting users tap their iPhone or an NFC-supported credit/debit card against the seller’s device to complete a transaction. It also supports Google and Samsung Pay for users on Android. Stripe was the first payment company to launch support for the feature, with Square rolling out a limited beta program in June. Square says sellers with an iPhone 11 or newer that runs iOS 15.5 or later can access the feature.
Now that Tap to Pay support is widely available with Square, sellers who want to process transactions won’t necessarily have to use the company’s card reader dongle, which attaches to a mobile device via the headphone jack or Lightning connector. That said, this likely doesn’t mean the dongle’s going away for good, as some sellers and buyers might not have a compatible phone to access the feature in the first place.]]></summary>

Ubisoft Singapore just cannot get the pirate sim out of drydock
 Skull & Bones, Ubisoft Singapore’s ambitious but beleaguered open-world pirate adventure, is delayed again. The publisher says it will now launch March 9, 2023.
Ubisoft announced the delay on Wednesday; Skull & Bones had been slotted for a Nov. 8 launch on Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. 
“While the game development is finished at this stage, the extra time will be used to further polish and balance the experience using players’ feedback from our Technical tests and Insider Program which happened over the past two weeks,” Ubisoft said in a statement. “This is the right decision both for our players and for the long-term success of the game as March 9, 2023 provides for a suitable release window for this very unique new brand.”
Skull & Bones was announced at E3 2017, but development on it may be traced back to 2013’s pirate-themed Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag. Originally given a late 2018 launch window, it has been delayed four times over the past four years.


Ubisoft Singapore, despite a lengthy project that Kotaku reported in 2021 had cost more than $120 million, appeared to turn a corner this summer when it hosted a one-hour gameplay reveal livestream and confirmed Nov. 8 as Skull & Bones’ launch date.
Set in the Indian Ocean in the 17th century, on a map stretching from the east coast of Africa to Malaysia, Skull and Bones puts players in the role of a pirate captain seeking to make a name for themselves. Starting with a tiny ship and a spear, they’ll quickly work their way up to commanding larger vessels and crews, managing the ongoing threat of mutiny and finding enough food and plunder to placate everyone.]]></summary>

The newest Kindle is the first truly new Kindle in years. It’s called the Kindle Scribe, and it’s both a reading device and a writing one. With a 10.2-inch E Ink screen, a stylus that attaches to the side of the device, and a bunch of new software, the $339.99 Scribe is trying to be as much a tablet as an ebook reader. It’s available for preorder today, and Amazon promises it’ll be out before the holidays. It’s also the kind of device people have been waiting for Amazon to make for years.


Kevin Keith, a vice president of product and marketing at Amazon, says the display is the reason the Scribe took so long. “This is the first 300ppi, front-lit display that has an adjustable warm light,” he says over Amazo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Commonwealth, explained.
 After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom; she was also still the leader of an organization that, on a map, looks a lot like the British Empire.
The British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the monarchy made a play to keep ties and preserve their global influence by allowing newly independent republics to join the Commonwealth, too. The only catch: They had to accept the queen as the leader of the organization. With her death, this vestige of the British Empire is now under the leadership of King Charles III. So what exactly is the Commonwealth? Why is it still here? And will it survive?

Chelsea Lane was the head performance therapist with the Golden State Warriors when she first started checking her athletes with a product from NeuroSync, a neurotechnology company making a tool that tracks eye movements to understand brain health. Lane initially used it as part of the team’s concussion protocols. But when she moved to the Atlanta Hawks in 2018, she started using the information in another way: to try and understand how well her athletes were sleeping. 
“I had some freedom to explore the idea that — whilst not its intended purpose — I might just have tech in my hands that could help me better understand and manage fatigue in my over-worked and under slept population by tracking their eye function,” Lane, now the head of high performance at Basketball New…]]></summary>

This Friday, Elon Musk is expected to unveil a prototype of his Optimus robot — better known as the Tesla Bot. When Musk announced last August that Tesla was developing a general-purpose robot capable of handling “unsafe, repetitive or boring” tasks, the reaction from experts was skeptical. A year on and not much has changed, with roboticists telling The Verge that we’re a long way off building a robot that can outright replace human labor.
That doesn’t mean, though, that they’re not excited to see what Tesla has come up with. 
“We still have fundamental robotics technology gaps that need to be solved before we will see ‘human level’ anything,” Will Jackson, CEO of robotics company Engineered Arts, tells The Verge. Jackson sees a lack …]]></summary>

Superheroes, Hot Wheels, and Superhot
 Injustice 2, Hot Wheels Unleashed, and Superhot will be offered to PlayStation Plus Essential subscribers beginning Oct. 4, Sony announced on Wednesday. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed (for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5) is the newest game of the three, launching a year ago. Milestone’s racer isn’t necessarily a kart game — it employs strong racing physics as well as arcade-racing mechanisms like turbo boosts. It was a Polygon Recommends selection when it launched in September 2021.
Injustice 2, for PS4, from Mortal Kombat maker NetherRealm Studios, launched in 2017 and is the sequel to the 2013 DC Universe fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us. There was also a companion comic book series explaining the somewhat convoluted story that had Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all duking it out among one another.
Superhot, from the eponymous Superhot Team, began life in early 2016 as a puzzle/action game for Windows PC, quickly moving to Xbox One and Oculus virtual reality adaptations. In it, players control a stylized action hero who has to think his way through a bullet-time fight with numerous adversaries. In Superhot, time only moves when the player does, giving them plenty of opportunity to think about their next move in a John Wick-style badass sequence. The PlayStation 4 version of Superhot launched in 2017.
PlayStation Plus subscribers can still pick up September’s Essential-level games — Need for Speed: Heat, Granblue Fantasy: Versus, and Toem — through Oct. 3.]]></summary>

Square Enix’s experimental year continues
 Some friends and I have a saying about video games: “Less talk-y, more do-y.” It’s an extremely broad (and sometimes refutable) criticism aimed at the fact that, more often than not, video games are better when they let their gameplay speak for them. The DioField Chronicle is the latest champion of this sentiment.
Released last week, The DioField Chronicle is yet another in Square Enix’s wealth of 2022 releases. Billed as a tactical RPG, it eschews the turn-based grid combat of a Fire Emblem, XCOM, or Final Fantasy Tactics, opting instead for real-time battles on freeform maps. As Oli Welsh pointed out in August, it plays sort of like a MOBA. My own playthrough unfolded like an A-Team training montage as I swa…]]></summary>

Progressive web apps on Windows look more like native Windows apps than ever before. Thanks to a new feature that Microsoft just announced, the Window Controls Overlay, developers can now customize the title bar of their PWAs. 
Previously, web apps did not have access to this feature, which could lead to empty space, clashing colors, and other oddities that made some PWAs look decidedly un-app-like. The new feature should help developers fix these problems. Web apps now have access to the “full surface area” of their app window, excluding only the buttons in the top-right corner — minimize, etc. remain untouchable.

 Publishers Electronic Arts and Koei Tecmo and Dynasty Warriors series developer Omega Force revealed a new take on the monster-hunting genre on Wednesday: Wild Hearts, an action-focused hunting game set in fantasy feudal Japan, where players will battle giant “nature-infused beasts” called Kemono.
Differentiating Wild Hearts from Capcom’s Monster Hunter series is a mechanic called Karakuri, which are described as “sophisticated mechanisms crafted from a lost, ancient technology.” As seen in the debut trailer for Wild Hearts, those Karakuri include things like fantastical giant mallets, ballistae, and bombs that can handicap, stun, or damage giant creatures.

Though Marvel’s upcoming Blade reboot starring Mahershala Ali was meant to start production this year ahead of its debut next fall, the movie’s just hit something of a significant hiccup with the unexpected departure of director Bassam Tariq.
In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter last night, Marvel attributed Tariq’s Blade exit to “continued shifts in our production schedule” and thanked him for his contributions to the project thus far. In his own statements, Tariq echoed the studio’s sentiments about their working relationship having been a good one and expressed his eagerness “to see where the next director takes the film.”
Details about the new Blade have been surprisingly sparse since the project was first announced to much fanfare back at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, and it wasn’t until last year’s Eternals that the studio began teasing out how the daywalking vampire might pop up in the MCU. While it’s always notable when a director dips out of a movie like this, it also isn’t all that uncommon or surprising given how far out from their actual production start dates these things are always announced. In the same way that the new Fantastic Four movie found Matt Shakman to direct after Jon Watts’ exit, it won’t be long before someone steps up to the plate and gets ahold of Blade, which is still slated to hit theaters on November 3rd, 2023.]]></summary>

Production was set to begin on the MCU installment in November
 Marvel Studios’ forthcoming Blade reboot has lost its director, Bassam Tariq, less than two months before production was expected to begin, Variety reported Tuesday. The departure could complicate the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s packed schedule, which has Blade premiering Nov. 3, 2023.
Tariq confirmed to Variety he was out as director; but the trade also reported that Tariq is still attached to the project as executive producer. “Eager to see where the next director takes the film,” Tariq told Variety.
Blade, a reboot of Wesley Snipes’ vampire-hunting cult hit from 1998, was revealed at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. It is slated to be part of the MCU’s “Phase 5,” announced at SDCC this past July. 


Although this film is part of the overall MCU, Blade is a key figure among the super-monsters subgenre that Marvel Comics spun up in several 1970s publications, including crossovers with The Amazing Spider-Man. The most recent screen adaptation from this line of heroes and villains was March’s poorly received (and non-MCU Sony Pictures adaptation) Morbius.
That said, Marvel Studios keeps its releases on a tight schedule and often teases or links them up narratively, in post-credits sequences or the films themselves. If Tariq leaving Blade as director delays the movie overall, it could affect other Phase 5 movies, like May 2023’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 or The Marvels, planned for July 28, 2023.
Blade made his first MCU appearance with actor Mahershala Ali’s voice-over in a post-credits sequence for 2021’s Eternals, in which Blade speaks to The Black Knight, Dane Whitman (played by Kit Harington).]]></summary>

We can’t tell what’s a joke anymore
 In true Deadpool fashion, Ryan Reynolds bypassed Marvel’s giant San Diego Comic-Con and D23 events and instead updated fans on the status of Deadpool 3 via a quippy video on Twitter. On Tuesday, Reynolds announced that not only was the Deadpool sequel officially in the works at Marvel Studios (after being in limbo in the wake of Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox), but the Merc with a Mouth would bring one of his X-Men friends along for the ride: Wolverine. Despite retirement, Hugh Jackman would pick up his claws one more time for Deadpool 3.
The news immediately raised questions about what the heck Deadpool 3 would be about, and when it would take place. Jackman’s run as Wolverine ended definitively — as far as comi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, EA announced that it was partnering with Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force on a Monster Hunter-style action game. Today, the companies finally showed off the first trailer for the title, which has been dubbed Wild Hearts (not to be confused with the excellent indie game Sayonara Wild Hearts). It’s described as “an epic adventure set in a fantasy world inspired by feudal Japan,” and the first footage shows gameplay that looks faster than Monster Hunter, with inventive traps, sweeping locales, and some truly vicious beasts. The game will be playable solo or via “seamless co-op.”
Here’s the basic premise, per EA:
Wild Hearts takes place in Azuma, a fantasy landscape inspired by feudal Japan, that is now rampaged by the once peaceful Kemono — altering their environment at the cost of citizens’ lives. The Kemono range from plant-infused squirrels to the massive Kingtusk wild boar. After a dreadful fight with the winter wolf Deathstalker, players become bearers of a life-sustaining technology and are compelled to restore balance across the region. 

The fact that EA is entering the hunting genre is no surprise, given the success of Monster Hunter World. First released in 2018, the more open-ended take on the long-running series went on to become the best-selling release in Capcom’s history, selling more than 18 million copies across multiplatforms. (And it’s on top by a large margin: Capcom’s second best-selling game is Resident Evil 7, with 11 million units.) To date, though, there has been little in the way of competition to MonHun’s unique style of action.
While Omega Force is best known for the Dynasty Warriors franchise, the studio has steadily expanded into creating spinoffs for some of the biggest franchises in gaming, including The Legend of Zelda and Fire Emblem.
Wild Hearts is launching on February 17th, 2023, on the PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.]]></summary>

True crime has made huge strides in centering the victim. But we keep getting series like the Netflix docudrama.
 True crime has always been complicated, morally speaking. At a minimum, it takes the real stories of victims, their families, and their killers and repackages them as entertainment for the public’s consumption. 
Should we expect a person impacted by a crime to be okay with having their story trotted out for the general public? Does it matter if they aren’t? What about when the story leans heavily into the old ways of true crime storytelling — tabloidy, sensationalistic, glorifying the serial killer at the e…]]></summary>

As well as accessibility options and improved UI tied to the game’s PS5 and Xbox Series X release
 Developer Supermassive Games and publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment announced on Wednesday that Man of Medan, the first installment in the interactive survival-horror drama series The Dark Pictures Anthology, will receive new free content in the form of a new chapter called, “Flooded,” featuring new gameplay and player deaths added to the climax of the game. 
Not only that, but both Man of Medan and Little Hope, the second game in The Dark Pictures Anthology, have received a free update in the form of improved UI, updated art and event triggers, accessibility options, and other additions tied to the game’s release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X this week. Bandai Namco said the updates provide players “an even greater immersive experience.”
The Dark Pictures Anthology is a series of stand-alone, branching cinematic horror games in the vein of Supermassive’s other titles, like 2015’s Until Dawn and 2022’s The Quarry. 
In our review of Man of Medan, Polygon’s Austen Goslin wrote that “While the characters and their relationships feel detailed and fleshed out, Man of Medan’s overall story never quite manages to make it beyond its ghost-ship premise.” Polygon’s Cass Marshall wrote in their review of Little Hope that that game “fails to capture the Shared Story magic that the previous game in the Dark Pictures Anthology, Man of Medan, managed to pull off.”
In addition to PS5 and Xbox Series X, Man of Medan and Little Hope are available for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.]]></summary>

 There are two main reactions to Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro, which will be available September 23rd for the same $249 as the original pair released in 2019. 
The first is “that’s it?” Apple has left the overall design and in-ear fit practically unchanged. The new AirPods Pro look identical to their predecessors. Despite arriving nearly three years after the first model, there’s been no major revamp. No shortened or eliminated stems. No new color choices. From a side view of your head, these are the same AirPods Pro as ever. It’s easy to be underwhelmed.

Just a little bit of Wiglett revealed
 The Pokémon Company revealed a sort-of-new Pokémon coming to Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet this November: Wiglett, a Paldean region-spin on the lovable ground-type, Diglett. Wiglett is long, white, and loves hanging out on the beach.
Wiglett was revealed in a somewhat unusual fashion, as part of a faux Zoom call between members of the World Ecological Pokémon Society, which is being shown a presentation on the Paldean region by Jacq, the player’s homeroom teacher in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. During the video, various biomes and Paldean Pokémon are shown, including another newcomer, Paldean Wooper. Society members remark on Wiglett’s appearance, likening it to a region-specific version of Diglett — even though it is apparently a separate species.
Whether Wiglett will evolve into another form — as Diglett does into Dugtrio — is unknown. You can watch the Wiglett reveal in this video uploaded by Serebii, if you don’t want to sit through the entire World Ecological Pokémon Society presentation. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will be released Nov. 18 for Nintendo Switch. The newest mainline game will introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon and the new Paldean region. Players will be able to catch brand-new Pokémon like Armarouge, Ceruledge, Klawf, Grafaiai, Fidough, Paldean Wooper (aka Pooper), Cetitan, Cyclizar, Smoliv, Lechonk, and Pawmi. Those new creatures join Scarlet and Violet’s new starters Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly, and two new Legendary Pokémon (Koraidon and Miraidon), in the series’ Pokédex.]]></summary>

While we have an idea of what to expect, Google may still have a few surprises in store. Here’s everything we’re looking forward to at the upcoming Google Pixel event.
The Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro to arrive with incremental upgrades
There wouldn’t be a Pixel launch event without a new generation of Pixel smartphones. We’re going to see what Google has in store for the Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, which Google offered a brief glimpse of during I/O back in May.
At the event, Google showed off renders of the devices, which each come with an aluminum camera bar and the upgraded Tensor G2 chip (we’ll get to tha…]]></summary>

Mon Mothma isn’t a hero Cassian would respect — yet
 As we see in this week’s Andor, Mon Mothma is far from the height of her powers. Though seen only briefly in the Star Wars films, the Republic leader’s legacy looms large: She’s one of the few to stand against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the final days of the Republic; she secretly helped found the Rebel Alliance; and eventually she became the leader and face of the organization. But in Andor she is only partway on that journey. Here Mon Mothma is just a senator, surreptitiously working to fight against the very fascist regime she’s trapped within.

Believe it or not, Dylan Field tells me over Zoom this week, when he started Figma he was only thinking about one thing: making cool design tools. In was 2012, and Field and co-founder Evan Wallace had the idea of building design software for the web browser — making the design process live, interactive, and collaborative — in ways it hadn’t really been in software before.
The idea was much easier to imagine than it was to build. Figma was building in stealth mode for three years before its first public preview, but the hard technical work paid off. Figma was a hit with designers almost immediately, as the real-time collaboration it enabled made design processes — particularly software design processes — much more efficient than they had …]]></summary>

Get the latest news on Amazon’s brands from the event
 Amazon’s annual fall event is here, and the company is expected to announce new products from across its many brands — and that’s likely to mean a lot of products. We’d expect to see products from some of Amazon’s own product lines, like the Amazon Echo and Fire TV, and also some from the companies it owns, like Eero, Ring, and Blink.
This annual September event is usually a busy one for Amazon. And in the past, it’s used the event to launch some surprising and quirky things, from a ring drone to an Alexa microwave. So it’s hard to predict exactly what we’ll see.
The Verge will keep you updated on the news coming out of the invite-only event. It’s set to kick off on Wednesday, September 28th, at 9AM PT / 12PM ET, and we’ll have coverage live.]]></summary>

Film of classic children’s book hails from great Irish studio Cartoon Saloon and launches on Nov. 11
 Netflix has revealed the release date and first trailer for My Father’s Dragon, an animated feature based on the classic children’s book. The film, made by the great Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon (Wolfwalkers), will be released on Nov. 11.
My Father’s Dragon is about a young boy called Elmer Elevator. Discomfited by a move to a new city, Elmer befriends a talking alley cat, who tells him about a baby dragon being kept captive on Wild Island. Elmer resolves to rescue the dragon — a plump thing, with blue and yellow candy stripes — and adventures to Wild Island, where he must outwit many cunning animals to reach his goal.
In the surreal 1948 book, written by Ruth Stiles Gannett and indelibly illustrated by her stepmother Ruth Chrisman Gannett, Elmer grows up to be the father of the book’s narrator — hence its title. Judging by the charming trailer, it seems Cartoon Saloon is keeping this conceit going with a voiceover framing device.
The film is directed by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Nora Twomey, who also directed two of studio’s best films — The Secret of Kells and The Breadwinner, both nominated for Oscars, and both featured in our list of the best animated movies of the 2010s. It could not have a better pedigree. The cast includes Jacob Tremblay (Room, Luca) as Elmer and Gaten Matarazzo (Stranger Things) as Boris the Dragon, as well as the likes of Dianne Wiest, Rita Moreno, Chris O’Dowd, Judy Greer, Alan Cumming, Whoopi Goldberg, and Ian McShane.

Cloudflare is testing a new kind of CAPTCHA that tests your browser instead of you. The company calls it Turnstile, and it’s designed to spare us from performing those mundane click-the-traffic-light kinds of tasks to verify you’re a human and not a bot.
Turnstile is being presented as “a user-friendly, privacy preserving alternative” to CAPTCHA. According to a press release, it will get rid of the interactive challenges used to verify people, which Cloudflare says normally take an average of 32 seconds to pass, and reduce the entire process to one second.

Amazon has some new products on the way. The company is holding an invite-only, virtual event today, where it’s expected to introduce products from across its lineup of brands. 
Chances are, there’s going to be a lot to see. Amazon is unusually good at keeping its upcoming releases under wraps, and it usually uses its annual September event to announce a lot of new products. Those could come from Amazon’s own product lineup — which includes the Kindle, Fire TV, and Echo — and from some of its acquired brands, like Eero, Ring, and Blink.
The Echo is the big one to keep an eye on. It’s been a while since we saw new updates for the Echo, which last saw a new version of its standard and Dot models in 2020. The Kindle just saw a major update to its entry-level model, but it’s been around three years since the higher-end Oasis was updated. The Fire TV Stick just got an update last year, but it is possible Amazon could have other parts of the Fire TV ecosystem it wants to update.
Then there’s Ring and Eero. Those product lines are a lot harder to predict. But if we do see them, there’s a good chance they’ll continue to build out the product ecosystems they’ve already been working on since they’ve had fairly recent additions to some of their key products.
The event is being livestreamed on an invite-only basis, so it’s not open to the public. The Verge will be covering the event as it happens, giving you updates as they come in through our live blog. The event kicks off at 9AM PT / 12PM ET.

Practical questions for creating community, according to Priya Parker.
 Even when times are normal, figuring out how to host — or attend — a gathering can be fraught. What do you wear? Who will be there? What will happen while you’re there? When will everyone go home?
And now the pandemic has thrown an extra wrench into things. Not just because people have varying levels of comfort and ability to gather; the disruption to our normal life patterns have left some of us feeling drained of our past ability to socialize for days on end. Or we feel like we’ve forgotten the social scripts that governed our interactions. We’re all awkward. 
Yet gathering in some form is essential to our social, mental, and even physical health; humans aren’t meant to exist without…]]></summary>

The publisher is releasing (at least) 9 games in the next 3 months, and I’ve played most of them
 Reeling from pandemic production issues — and, perhaps, a gradual shift toward more sustainable working practices — the video game industry is well into a product drought. After a barren summer, we are facing a meager release schedule through fall and toward the end of the year, with few of the major titles and platform exclusives that usually adorn the season. By all accounts, late 2022 is a quiet time for video games.
But nobody told Square Enix.
The venerable Japanese publisher has a stacked release schedule. Between mid-September and mid-December it is releasing no less than nine games — and as many as 12, if you count the PC version of Triangle Strategy, the L…]]></summary>

Instagram’s test of a new feature that lets you post a text note to your followers appears to be getting a wider rollout, XDA Developers reports. When available, the feature displays in the messages section of the app, below the search bar. “Share what’s on your mind…” the prompt in the text box reads, according to a screenshot posted by XDA. “People won’t be notified when you leave a note. They can see your note for 24 hours and reply with a message.” 
TechCrunch reported in June that the feature was being tested with a limited selection of users, but the fact that XDA has the feature working on multiple devices suggests its availability is expanding. Notes can be up to 60 characters in length, according to TechCrunch.

Wacom has announced the Cintiq Pro 27, its latest pen display for creative professionals such as photo editors and digital artists. It takes on a new look more similar to that of a traditional computer monitor, and features a compact design with slim bezels, 4K resolution, HDR support, and a customizable pen. 
The Cintiq Pro 27 comes in at $3,500 and is available to buy now direct through Wacom or third-party retailers. That price frustratingly doesn’t include a stand, which is required now that Wacom has removed the retractable legs found on older Cintiq models. The official Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 Stand will set you back an additional $500, and is fully adjustable, supporting 20 degrees of display rotation.

Computer chips are ubiquitous, but they’re only made in a few places. 
 In a single day, we interact with hundreds of computer chips, most no larger than a penny. These tiny circuits power everything from smartphones and laptops to medical devices and electric vehicles, and they’re largely responsible for our increasingly computerized lives. But in recent months, the world’s dependence on these chips has also put them at the center of mounting tensions between the United States and mainland China over Taiwan. 
Taiwan is located just 100 miles from China’s eastern coast, and it produces the vast majority of the advanced chips used in today’s electronics. The island is a democracy with its own government, and is home to more than 20 million people. Officials…]]></summary>

Don’t Worry Darling and Barbarian want us to remember gender is scary.
 In most respects, the recent films Don’t Worry Darling and Barbarian could not be more different. 
Darling, directed by Olivia Wilde, is a glossy period piece, set in a 1950s desert town where nothing is quite what it seems. It has opulent production values, plenty of well-known stars, and a premise straight out of a Black Mirror episode. 
Barbarian, directed by Zach Cregger, is a pitch-black horror-comedy, set in a modern-day Detroit that is riddled with maze-like tunnels running underneath the city. For much of its run time, it focuses on just two actors, and its production value…]]></summary>

Progressives and Republicans came together to shoot down a bill on permitting reforms. 
 In a surprising team-up, progressives and Republicans banded together to oppose a bill backed by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) that would have loosened oil and gas permitting regulations, forcing lawmakers to drop the measure from a must-pass government funding package.
Following growing pressure from both groups, Manchin called for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to cut the permitting reforms from a short-term funding bill just before it was scheduled to go up for a vote on Tuesday. 
Manchin said in a statement he didn’t want to put government funding at risk and added that “a fa…]]></summary>

Tumblr is adding a new filtering feature called “community labels.” Contrary to speculation from some users, Tumblr’s parent company, Automattic, says its broader rules haven’t changed so far — but the feature might lay the groundwork for a more liberal moderation policy.
Community labels, announced yesterday, make the site’s moderation tools more granular. Tumblr is asking users to tag posts that depict or reference three categories of content: drug and alcohol addiction, violence “similar to what you might see in an age-restricted movie,” and “sexual themes” including “erotic writing or imagery.” Adding any of them will add a “mature” label to the post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine | Image: Marvel Studios
    

  
In what could best be described as a very predictable move that’s going to have multiple generations of Marvel fans losing their minds, Hugh Jackman has joined the cast of Marvel Studios’ Deadpool 3 as Wolverine, everyone’s favorite Canadian mutant.
Deadline reports that Jackman will reprise his role as Wolverine for Shawn Levy’s Deadpool 3 — the first time he’s portrayed the character since James Mangold’s Logan in 2017. Jackman’s reprisal is of particular note given how Deadpool 3 will be the franchise’s first film following Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2017, which brought all of the X-Men IP (which includes both Wolverine and Deadpool) back to Marvel Studios. While there was initially some concern as to whether the Deadpool franchise would keep its hard edge after becoming part of the MCU, Kevin Feige’s said that Marvel intends to keep the mutant mercenary in R-rated territory.

Logan, the last movie to feature Wolverine, was similarly darker and more mature than any of Fox’s previous X-Men movies featuring Jackman as the character, and it makes a certain amount of sense that he’ll return on a similar note. Of course, this, certain parts of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Ms. Marvel all beg the question of just what Marvel Studios is planning to do with the rest of the X-Men characters who’ve yet to pop up in the MCU. But with Marvel’s current phase of films drawing near its end, it feels safe to assume that folks with x-factors are a big part of the studio’s plays for the near future.

Fortnite’s newest skin references the phrase “dead game,” which is a long-running diss-turned-joke in video game communities online. The skin comes as part of a new aesthetic items pack called the “Checkered Past Pack.” The pack has multiple items, one which is the skin which wears black nail polish, a checkered hat, and a sleeveless black turtleneck with the phrase “Dead game,” printed in white lettering on the top.

— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) September 27, 2022



The phrase references a long-running meme used by people to dismiss a game or claim it’s no longer relevant. Basically the phrase is used to imply that a game has fallen off and is no longer played and liked by people any more. (A phrase that has for many a moon, been used to describe Fortnite despite not actual evidence to support it.) Because it’s so commonly misapplied to games that maintain active playerbases, it’s often used as a sarcastic retort to players who might think interest in a specific game is waning.
It’s a playful way for the developers to wink back at potential haters. If you think the skin is cute well you’re in luck. At time of publication, the full pack is available to purchase in Fortnite’s item shop and is available for purchase for $3.99 or 600 V-Bucks.]]></summary>

The Try Guys built a loyal following by pulling stunts on the internet, like baking pies without knowing what they were doing or using devices that simulate the pain of going into labor. But over the last few days, fan pages have been buzzing with rumors that one of the guys was also trying infidelity. 
Fans on the Try Guys subreddit began to notice that Ned Fulmer, one of four members of the YouTube group, was missing from recent videos and other content. Speculation swirled, and fans exchanged theories of what was happening, including that Fulmer was being hastily edited out of content. The rumors hit a boiling point and spilled onto other social media platforms when o…]]></summary>

Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you
 With a couple of exceptions, the word that best summarizes 2022’s big phone launches is “iterative.” This year has been all about small incremental updates that make for more polished devices but don’t offer a lot of incentive to upgrade. If you bought a flagship phone within the past couple of years and you’re happy with how it’s performing, then you’re probably safe to hold off for another year. But if it’s time for a new one, you’ll find that today’s crop of top-tier devices is just a little bit better: more mature, with some minor rough edges smoothed out. 
One thing that hasn’t changed about this year’s flagship class? The high prices. For the most part, they ha…]]></summary>

If you were intrigued by Asus’ Zenbook 17 Fold OLED but put off by the fact that it, well, folded, there is now a more... normie option for you. Asus has announced the Zenbook Pro 17, a ginormous version of its highly regarded, portable Zenbook line (and the first Zenbook with a 17.3-inch screen). 
The device starts at $999 and will be available from Asus and Amazon. Ship dates are yet to be announced. That pricing puts it below many of the best-known 17-inchers in the consumer space today. The Dell XPS 17 and LG Gram 17, two of the best-known products in this category, currently start at $1,849 and $1,199, respectively. 
Earlier this year, Asus announced an almost-as-large Zenbook Pro 16X OLED, starting at $2,599. The Pro 17, while bigger,…]]></summary>

Ryan Reynolds gives a surprising update on Deadpool’s first MCU film
 Deadpool is officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Deadpool 3, which got a teaser video on Tuesday. The video was released by Wade Wilson himself, Ryan Reynolds, and was more like a real-life tease than an actual trailer. But Reynolds reveals that Deadpool 3 is on the way, and more importantly that Hugh Jackman will be reprising his role as Wolverine for the film. The film even got a release date: Sept. 6, 2024.
In the clip, Reynolds explains that they’ve been working on the film for a long time now, but that they’re fresh out of ideas on how to revive the mercenary for the MCU. But they do have one trick up their sleeve, Reynolds says, and that’s when Hugh Jackman walks by…]]></summary>

 Shipping is fun, and League of Legends offers a veritable armada of potential ships to sail. The roster has over 160 champions, some of whom are canonically together, while others have plenty of in-universe justification for ships. Then, there’s the just-for-fun ships, the combinations of champions that haven’t happened to meet yet and may never meet. But once in a while, these long-shot ships pay off, and fans get to enjoy a feast of vindication.

Why Ned Fulmer is out of the popular YouTube group
 On Tuesday, popular YouTube group The Try Guys announced they have parted with co-creator and executive producer Ned Fulmer. The group shared the announcement on social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, and it caps off a day of intense internet sleuthing, speculation, and conspiracy from fans.
“Ned Fulmer is no longer working with The Try Guys,” the statement reads. “As a result of a thorough internal review, we do not see a path forward together. We thank you for your support as we navigate this change.” 
The group’s Twitter bio has already been updated to remove Fulmer’s handle, and their social media avatars across the brand’s pages have been change…]]></summary>

A dataminer claimed to find the files with Mark Hamill’s voice
 Mark Hamill could be the voice of the Joker in Warner Bros.’ fighting game, MultiVersus, a new datamine revealed on Tuesday. The actor, who is perhaps most known for playing Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars series is also one of the most recognizable voices of Joker. The actor first played Batman’s iconic nemesis in Batman: The Animated Series, and now it’s looking like he’ll reprise his role in the game.
The Joker was previously rumored to be a fighter in the game thanks to a March datamine. The new audio containing the Joker’s lines was posted on Twitter by user Laisul. In the video, you can hear all of Joker’s match announcement lines, in a voice that sounds quite a bit like Hamill’s. 
Polygon reached out to a representative of the development team to confirm the leak, and will update this story as we hear back. 
Hamill has reprised his role as The Clown Prince of Crime several times since his first appearance in the 1992 animate series, including in games like the Batman: Arkham series and Lego DC Super-Villains.
MultiVersus is a free-to-play competitive fighting game series that features a cast of fighters from various Warner Bros. properties and series. Most recently, the developers added Rick Sanchez from the adult animation series Rick and Morty to the game.]]></summary>

Netflix is officially introducing gamertag-style handles subscribers can use in its mobile games. The company first began rolling out handles that will be shown in multiplayer games and on online leaderboards in some games last month, but in a blog post published Tuesday, Netflix said that users can now set them up on both iOS and Android devices.
The process of actually making your handle differs depending on which operating system you use. On Android, in the games tab in Netflix’s navigation bar, you can tap the banner that says “Create your Netflix game handle” to get started. The iOS version of the Netflix app doesn’t have a dedicated games tab, so you’ll need to download a game like Riv…]]></summary>

How a few election law fixes could protect democracy in 2024. 
 The human mind is ingenious. It can create towering works of art and make remarkable scientific discoveries. It is, as we saw in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, also capable of inventing new ways to undermine American democracy by abusing our existing election laws, and turning orderly presidential elections into anarchy and chaos. 
It’s beyond the ken of lawmakers, or perhaps anyone, to try to sniff out every potential avenue for havoc. But they can fix obvious defects in presidential elections once they have been exploited. 
The Electoral Count Reform Act currently before the Senate is an effort to do that, fitting into a long history of legislative action following a break…]]></summary>

Blizzard says Overwatch newcomers will need to play about 100 matches to unlock every classic hero
 Overwatch 2 players who are brand-new to the franchise — meaning those who never played the original Overwatch — will need to spend considerable time with the sequel to unlock the game’s existing roster of 32 heroes. Blizzard Entertainment said Tuesday that as part of Overwatch 2’s “first-time user experience,” new players will unlock the game’s modes and all original Overwatch heroes “over the course of approximately 100 matches.”
Blizzard cited “consistent feedback from new players feeling overwhelmed by numerous game modes and heroes” in a blog post explaining how the game maker plans to accommodate an influx of newcomers with Overwatch’s free-to-pla…]]></summary>

Robinhood has launched the beta for its “Web3 wallet” for 10,000 iOS users who signed up for the waitlist. The company teased this product earlier this year after making an earlier crypto wallet more broadly available. Unlike its existing cryptocurrency wallet, the Web3 wallet isn’t just for storing cryptocurrencies that can be traded on the financial platform — it can also be used to “seamlessly access the decentralized web,” as Robinhood’s press release puts it. The wallet will also let people trade cryptocurrencies without any fees.

In a major turnaround, Apple is bringing Stage Manager, one of iPadOS’s signature new features, to more iPads. Stage Manager, a new multitasking system, was previously set to be available only on iPads with M1 chips. Now, however, the feature will also be coming to third- and fourth-generation iPad Pros (which have the A12X Bionic and A12Z Bionic chips, respectively), according to a statement shared with Engadget.
Unfortunately, Apple is also delaying one aspect of Stage Manager, and it’s one that will remain exclusive to iPads with M1 chips. Support for using Stage Manager with external displays won’t be available until a software update coming later this year.

Now That’s What I Call Hellsinger
 Thrash-and-blast rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger has a pretty simple hook: It’s extremely fun to pump demons full of lead in time with your favorite hard-rocking artists absolutely shredding on guitar. However, those with different musical sensibilities might not necessarily get that. That’s okay, because Metal: Hellsinger developer The Outsiders have released modding tools that allow savvy players to add basically whatever music they want.
Like, for example, jazz.
We have Metal: Hellsinger. Now meet Jazz: Hellsinger.  
Unleash Hell to YOUR beat. Custom music modding is now available on PC!

— Metal: Hellsinger     OUT NOW! (@MetalHellsinger) September 27, 2022



Per the game’s official website, players who have Metal: Hellsinger or its demo on PC can mod the game to work with any kind of music: K-Pop, EDM, hip-hop, or Kidz Bop. Given the nature of copyright enforcement, actually showing off those mods publicly might be tricky, but that just means folks will have to get even more creative. Imagine playing Metal: Hellsinger to the sultry tones of WTF with Marc Maron, or the outrageous stories on Normal Gossip. You already listen to podcasts while gaming, why not combine the two?]]></summary>

Samsung Display and Intel are working on “slidable” PCs. During Intel’s Innovation keynote today, Samsung Display CEO JS Choi appeared onstage to show off a prototype PC that slides from a 13-inch tablet into a 17-inch display.
“We’re announcing the world’s first 17-inch slidable display for PCs,” said Choi. “This device will satisfy various needs for a larger screen and portability as well.” Samsung Display has chosen to implement a sliding (rather than foldable) technology for its flexible PC displays, and Choi appeared to indicate that “foldable is gone” on PCs for now.

      Samsung Display’s concept PC slides into place.
  
Intel has been experimenting with new PC form factors for years and was initially preparing for a dual-screen and foldable future before Microsoft dropped its plans for Windows 10X on foldables. These types of new form factors desperately need the software and apps to make them shine, and it’s not clear yet how Intel will make slidable PCs a reality.
The prototype device that Samsung Display and Intel have shown off today essentially turns a 13-inch tablet into a 17-inch monitor with a flexible display and a sliding mechanism. Intel was quick to demonstrate its new Unison software on this display, which aims to connect Intel-powered computers to smartphones — including iPhones.
The slidable PC itself is just a concept for now, and there’s no word from Intel or Samsung Display on when it will become a reality.]]></summary>

With Defense Matrix, Blizzard is implementing several new account security and moderation tools, the biggest two of which are SMS Protect and voice chat transcriptions.

Terraria, Stardew Valley, Factorio, and more
 Base-building and management simulator games scratch a particular itch. There’s that perfect gameplay loop that comes from doing menial tasks and then, later, building systems to help automate those chores. But these games are often more fun with others, letting you create abominations together or ruthlessly mess with each other’s work. 
So we’ve created a list of some of our favorites that support cooperative play; mostly online multiplayer with a few entries that support couch co-op. This list broadly covers base-building, automation, survival, and certain types of crafting games. What they share in common is a particular game loop, with resource gathering and crafting complementary to other goals — f…]]></summary>

Valve is making a change to its schedule of big Steam sales. Starting in 2023, the company will be replacing the Lunar New Year sale, which it has run since 2016, with an annual spring sale, the company announced on Tuesday. The first version of this spring sale will take place from March 16th to March 23rd.
“The addition of a Spring Sale was a popular request from our developer and publisher community,” Valve says in a blog post about the news. “It will allow us to create more space between our four major seasonal sales and provide more opportunities throughout the year for developers to expand and execute their discounting calendar.” 
Now there’s a big Steam sale for every season
As for why it is discontinuing the Lunar New Year sale, which typically took place in late January or early February, Valve said it received feedback that the sale was too close to the “December holiday sale period.” That said, Valve expects that some publishers will still discount their games around the Lunar New Year in the future.
With this new spring sale, there will now be a major Steam sale for each season, and Valve has already shared the dates for its upcoming autumn and winter sales. The autumn sale will take place from November 22nd to November 29th, while the winter sale will happen from December 22nd to January 5th.]]></summary>

Intel is officially announcing pricing for its top Arc graphics card today. The top-of-the-line Arc A770 will arrive on October 12th, starting at $329. This price matches that of Nvidia’s RTX 3060, a card that the A770 is expected to comfortably outperform.
“We’ve been seeing that for a long time the price of GPUs is right in this $200–$300 range, but what’s happened in the last few years is that they’ve gotten super expensive,” says Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. “You should be frustrated because you are losing out as the gaming community, and today we’re fixing that.”
The A770 will include up to 16GB of GDDR6 memory, a 2100MHz clock, and 32 Xe cores. Intel hasn’t released full benchmarks for the A770 yet, but it shared some …]]></summary>

The year in anime keeps getting better and better
 2021 was a banner year for anime, featuring the long-awaited return of regular favorites such as Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, and My Hero Academia alongside exciting new original anime like Odd Taxi, The Heike Story, Sonny Boy, and SK8 the Infinity. 2022 is shaping up to be much of the same, with popular series such as Mob Psycho 100 and Bleach slated to make their return later this year. And all signs point to the highly anticipated debuts of Chainsaw Man and Uzumaki!
There’s a wealth to choose from and not nearly enough time in the day to watch it all, which is why we’ll be updating our list of the best anime airing in 2022 throughout the year as the seasons progress. Ta…]]></summary>

Four seasons of savings
 Great news for those who, like myself, love to buy video games at astonishingly low prices without nary a thought about whether or not there is enough time to play them: Valve has announced the dates for its next batch of seasonal Steam sales. 
The dates are as follows:
Autumn Sale: Nov. 22 - 29
Winter Sale: Dec. 22 - Jan. 5
Spring Sale: March 16 - 23
The spring sale will be new in 2023. According to Valve, the sale will replace the Lunar New Year sale on its calendar, and was added in order to make its seasonal sales more evenly spaced out.


If this is your first rodeo — and if you are the lucky owner of a new Steam Deck, it might be — Steam’s big seasonal sales are something of an event, with a little bit more to them than just steep markdowns. There’s usually some kind of gimmick that sends customers on scavenger hunts in the hopes that they will buy more in exchange for digital goodies. But also the games are hella cheap, which makes every sale an opportunity to play my favorite game: Role-playing someone with all the time in the world to finish every game I buy.]]></summary>

Google is updating its Play Store to make it easier to discover and download apps across the full range of Android devices — whether that’s Wear OS watches, Android TVs, Android tablets, or vehicles fitted with Android Auto. There are three updates in total: a new device-specific search filter, new sections in the Android app focused on devices that aren’t phones, and new options to remotely install apps from your phone. 
These updates come as Google is working to improve the Android hardware ecosystem beyond phones — a focus highlighted by the company’s own efforts to release more Android hardware options, including a Google Pixel smartwatch this year and a new Google tablet in 2023. It seems that if Google itself is offering a broader rang…]]></summary>

The 2023 Nissan Ariya will start at $44,485 when it goes on sale in the late fall, the automaker announced. That’s about $3,000 cheaper than the starting price announced by Nissan almost a year ago. 
The base model Ariya, which will have front-wheel drive and a 63 kWh battery pack, will start at $43,190. With a $1,295 destination charge, that price increases to $44,485. 
The Ariya, which was first announced in summer 2020, was expected to go on sale in Japan in the middle of 2021, followed by the US and Canada later in the year. But that’s been delayed, with North American customers not expected to receive deliveries until later this year.

The words “Nintendo” and “online” usually can’t be uttered in the same sentence without a few chuckles and murmurs. But I’m legitimately impressed with the latest update to its Nintendo Switch Online app for iOS and Android. Paid subscribers can now add Splatoon 3-specific widgets to their phone or tablet homescreen. 
Version 2.3.0 of the app for either platform adds the ability to use three new widgets: a photo album to see the pictures that you’ve snapped from the game, your battle log to show your recent wins and losses, and finally — my favorite — a stage schedule that fills you in on the upcoming stage rotation for various game modes. That one also shows what gear you have equipped and what abilities that gear has.
If you can’t get enough Splatoon 3 (I represented Team Gear, winner of the most recent Splatfest — just sayin’), using these widgets is a good way to constantly be tapped into your obsession. Each of the widgets is a different size (and can be modified slightly), so organize your homescreen accordingly.
Here’s how the new widgets look on my Android phone homescreen.
  
It’s ironic and kind of great that Splatoon 3 brought about this forward-thinking online integration out of Nintendo. Compared to previous installments, this game’s online modes are much easier to join and play with friends, and this update is further evidence that Nintendo is more serious than ever before about online. Though, I still haven’t forgotten about that convoluted voice chat solution it devised for Splatoon 2.]]></summary>

Netflix has released the official trailer for The Playlist, its upcoming show about the creation of Spotify, and the nearly two-minute trailer indicates the show will be a very serious look at how the streaming giant built its empire. If you’re a fan of high-stakes business dramas, this one seems as though it will check a lot of the boxes; the trailer has glimpses of dramatic boardroom scenes, swanky parties, and even congressional testimony.
That said, if you’re looking for a completely accurate story about the rise of Spotify, this isn’t going to be it. While the trailer says this series is based on “6 untold stories,” Netflix spells out that the show is a “fictionalized account.” I’m guessing that means the creators will be playing a bit fast and loose with the historical facts in service of making something fit for a television series. To be clear, I think that’s a totally fine thing to do! Just don’t expect this to be a documentary. The series is inspired by Spotify Untold, a book about Spotify by two Swedish business reporters, according to Variety.
The Playlist, which will be a six-episode series, debuts on Netflix on October 13th. If you want another peek at what you can expect from the show, check out the teaser trailer from earlier this month.]]></summary>

Intel has announced an intriguing new app called Unison, which aims to “seamlessly” connect Intel-powered computers to smartphones — not just Android phones but iOS devices as well. 
Following what Intel says is a “simple pairing process,” the Unison app will allow PCs to replicate four key features of the connected phone. They can answer and make calls; they can share photos and files (pictures taken with the phone will show up in a specific Unison gallery on the PC); they can send and receive texts; and they can receive (and, in some cases, respond to) notifications that the phone receives — though if Unison is closed, they’ll go to the Windows notification center.

After weeks of teasers and leaks, Intel is finally making its 13th Gen processors official today. Intel’s 13th Gen desktop CPUs will start arriving on October 20th, led by the flagship Core i9-13900K priced at $589. That’s the same price as Intel’s previous 12900K flagship, despite Intel’s warning of price increases. Intel’s 13th Gen announcement comes just as AMD launches its new Ryzen 7000 processors today in a battle for desktop dominance.
Intel’s Core i9-13900K will ship with 24 cores, 32 threads, and clock speeds of up to 5.8GHz. Built on Intel’s 7 process and its x86 performance hybrid architecture, 13th Gen processors include Performance cores (P-cores) and Efficient cores (E-cores) that split workloads intelligently using Intel’s …]]></summary>

Alienware has introduced a slightly cheaper version of its 34-inch QD-OLED curved gaming monitor, scheduling it to launch in China first on October 18th, followed by the US and Canada on November 8th, 2022. While similar in many ways to the $1,299.99 AW3423DW it delivered in the spring, there are two key spots where Alienware made changes that help get the sticker price of this AW3423DWF down to $1,099.99 (note: this isn’t replacing the AW3423DW; both models will be sold simultaneously). Namely, it dropped Nvidia’s G-Sync Ultimate variable refresh rate (VRR) support in favor of AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and it lowered the refresh rate from 175Hz to 165Hz.

Samsung’s third One UI 5.0 beta arrived late last week, and users have started noticing that the lock screen customization options look pretty darn similar to those introduced by Apple in iOS 16 earlier this month (via 9to5Mac). While Samsung has been letting users customize their lock screens for years now, whether through its Good Lock app or its One UI system, its most recent update seems to take a lot of inspiration from Apple (although inspiration can flow in both directions).
Lock screen customization is one of the biggest changes in iOS 16, as Apple introduced widgets, new wallpaper options, and the ability to tweak everything from font type, colors, wallpaper filters, and more. The latest version of the beta gives Samsung users more con…]]></summary>

Nvidia is releasing an important driver update today for those on the latest Windows 11 2022 Update. The new Game Ready 517.48 driver fixes an issue with the GeForce Experience overlay causing stuttering and frame rate drops with Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 2022 Update.
Many Nvidia users had reported the issues last week, and Nvidia quickly issued a beta fix ahead of this new driver today. Alongside the big fixes for Windows 11, this new driver also includes additional Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) support for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

      Nvidia’s latest driver introduces full DLSS 2 support in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
  
“Developer Asobo Studio has just launched Sim Update 10, with the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 2,” explains Nvidia’s Andrew Burnes. “To take full advantage of this technology, our new Game Ready Driver is a required update.”
This latest driver is also optimized for Overwatch 2, which arrives as a free-to-play title on October 4th. Nvidia’s latency-reducing Reflex technology will also be supported in Overwatch 2. Four more G-Sync compatible displays are also supported in this new driver, including Sony’s new Inzone gaming monitors.

And they’re even more fun in the movie
 Bullet Train was one of this summer’s non-franchise delights, a violent action-comedy best described as John Wick by way of Looney Tunes. With its theatrical run now firmly behind it, the cinematic pain train from the director of Deadpool 2 is about to arrive at its next stop: video on-demand. 
A madcap action movie about a semi-retired assassin named Ladybug (Brad Pitt) trying his best to get a suitcase off a train full of other assassins who want the same thing, Bullet Train is the kind of movie one imagines was as fun to make as the comedy on screen. A behind-the-scenes look at the film, which arrives with the home video release, confirms as such. As a little teaser, Polygon can exclusively share a brief blooper reel, which mostly features two of the movies best characters, the duo Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), pal-ing around when they should be doing stuff like hurting people.
Bullet Train is now available on VOD, and arrives on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD on October 18.]]></summary>

 Four years ago, Electronic Arts’ chief design officer left to co-found his own studio, created with Nexon’s backing. On Monday, Patrick Söderlund’s studio showed off its first game: The Finals, a squad-based, free-to-play multiplayer shooter inspired by sci-fi bloodsport narratives like Squid Game and The Running Man, where pretty much everything on the game’s maps can be destroyed.
The Finals, said Embark Studios creative director Gustav Tilleby, is “a hero builder, not a hero shooter.” As shown in a debut trailer, players will have access to a variety of weapons and their tactical uses, from a katana and other melee weapons, to rocket launchers, and even a foam gun that can rei…]]></summary>

Humanity now has the beginnings of a true defense against asteroids. 
 At 7:14 EDT Monday night, something historic happened for the human species — and it took place more than 7 million miles from our planet.
NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft successfully collided with the asteroid moonlet Dimorphos, which circles the larger asteroid Didymos (hence the “double asteroid”). The 1,250-pound DART spacecraft hit the asteroid at approximately 14,760 mph — in the days to come, NASA scientists will pore over data to figure out how much Dimorphos’s momentum was changed by the collision, with initial estimates projecting that it moved 1 percent closer to …]]></summary>

Arm’s chips are in your iPhone — but what exactly does Arm do?
 One of the more interesting quirks of the modern tech world is that there’s a really important company at the center of it all that doesn’t make anything. But its work is in your phone, in your TV, your car, maybe even your laptop — and the data centers that keep all these things working. 
I’m talking about Arm, a chip design company that’s been through quite a lot these past few years.

The sci-fi franchise is all TV these days, and there’s something for (almost) everyone
 Here’s a wild statistic: There are nearly as many currently running Star Trek television series as there are completed Star Trek television series. The first 40 years of the franchise’s history include five live-action series and one animated spinoff, totaling 725 episodes. In the past five years, five new series have launched (six if you count Short Treks as its own entity), airing a cumulative 130 episodes as of today. Star Trek as a brand is busier than it’s been since the mid-1990s, when Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and the Next Generation TV series were all running concurrently and shops around the world dedicated entire displays to Star Trek toys, novels…]]></summary>

Rick Sanchez also joins the game’s roster
 MultiVersus has a new update that’s set to bring a few changes to the game. Beta patch 1.03 adds Rick Sanchez to the game as its newest fighter, makes a few balance tweaks, and most importantly significantly increases the amount of experience players need to hit level 15 with every character. 
According to the patch notes from developer Player First Games, the XP requirements for progressing from level 3 to level 15 have been doubled. The developer says that it’s making the change because it felt that players were progressing through the levels too quickly, and it wanted to “make it a bit more of a journey.” 
The only problem is, despite increasing the time it takes to earn these levels, Player First Games didn’t increase the rewards that players get for progressing. So it’s more work for the exact same reward. 
Other than this slightly frustrating adjustment, the patch also brings in the game’s latest character with Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty, and a new anti-infinite combo system that should help prevent players from getting caught in enemy combos that chain the same move together too many times in a row. 
MultiVersus patch 1.03 will arrive after the game’s maintenance, which should end around 1 p.m. ET. For a look at all of the changes in the latest MultiVersus patch you can check out the full patch notes.]]></summary>

If you’ve been intrigued by the high-tech Freewrite typewriter but put off by its price tag, manufacturer Astrohaus’ new design is (maybe) for you. Astrohaus is opening preorders for the Freewrite Alpha, a lower-profile version of its first-generation device. Like the original Freewrite, it’s billed as a distraction-free writing tool that syncs wirelessly with services like Google Drive or Dropbox but for $349 (or $249 for early orders) instead of the original Freewrite’s $649 price tag. An Indiegogo campaign launches today with a shipping date of July 2023.
The Alpha looks starkly different from either the gigantic original Freewrite or the $499 portable 2020 Freewrite Traveler, both of which will still be sold after its release. …]]></summary>

A classic trope, done two ways
 Perhaps you have noticed that two of the biggest television shows airing (or streaming) right now are both fantasy epics based on popular novels exploring the time period before a popular previous adaptation. While it would be reductive to call HBO’s House of the Dragon and Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power the same kind of show — they extremely are not — occasionally, in ways big and small, they do some of the same things. Like last weekend, when the latest episodes of each show both engaged in the classic trope of having an experienced sword fighter school some young whippersnappers in the best way to study the blade.

TikTok’s vertically-oriented, curated approach to social video has transformed feeds for better and worse, and the NBA is next in line with its newly redesigned app for Android and iOS. 
A major part of its individualized user experience is a “For You” vertical video feed that will show highlights from NBA games featuring “behind-the-scenes access to players and teams,” NBA-related shows, content from influencers, and the SiriusXM show NBA Today as well as showcase partnered channels like Turner Sports and Bleacher Report. 
Another modern social media feature the new NBA app includes is its “stories.” Similar to Snapchat, Instagram, and others, it has a horizontal selection of expiring videos that show top pl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sky Stream arrives on October 18th in the UK. | Image: Sky
    

  
British satellite broadcaster Sky is launching a Sky Stream puck next month that will let people access TV content over Wi-Fi instead of a satellite dish. While Sky launched its Glass platform in the UK last year, you had to buy a whole new TV to get access to Sky TV over the internet. Sky Stream launches on October 18th, and it means you can connect a puck to any TV and get Sky TV content over Wi-Fi or ethernet.
The Sky Stream device will plug into a pocket socket and a TV’s HDMI input, and it only requires a minimum speed of 10Mbps broadband. It’s capable of streaming HD as standard, but you can also add 4K and HDR streaming add-ons. It’s the latest move in Sky’s ambitious effort to move away from the satellite dishes that have defined its TV service for decades. 
Image: Sky

Pricing will start at £29 per month for a 31-day rolling contract that can be canceled at any time or £26 per month for an 18-month plan. The puck itself is essentially £39.95, as you’re paying a “setup fee,” or it’s £20 if you take out an 18-month contract. The basic package will provide access to Sky’s base offering of TV channels, and there are add-ons like Sky Cinema, Sky Sports, BT Sports, and 4K support that cost extra. You can also pick a whole home pack upgrade that lets you add up to five extra Sky Stream devices for £12 per month. 
Sky Stream will include the ability to restart live TV, but you won’t get the recording options found on Sky Q boxes that come with hard drive storage. Given so much content is available on demand in the UK now, that might not be a problem for most people seeking an alternative to satellite dish installation.]]></summary>

Whether you’re working from a noisy cafe or commuting on a train, a comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones can prove invaluable in the right setting. Thankfully, Bose’s QuietComfort 45 are currently matching their best price to date at Best Buy, where you can pick them up for $249 instead of $329 — a discount we haven’t seen in a while.
The lightweight QC45 are some of the most comfortable over-ears we’ve ever tested and can even last 24 hours on a single charge. That means you can don them for hours on end without worrying about running out of battery or ear fatigue. And when you do need to recharge them, you can do so quickly thanks to their s…]]></summary>

Augmented reality company Nreal is launching its stripped-down Air glasses in the United States.

For executive producer Erick Boenisch, that also meant some time spent reflecting. Reminiscing, even.

Remote code execution vulnerabilities are a key step in installing malware, spyware, or other malicious applications on a target system, as they give attackers a foot in the door that can be used to further compromise the m…]]></summary>

You’d be forgiven for forgetting, or just not knowing, that Skullcandy once had some skin in the game of putting out gaming headsets. The company owned Astro Gaming throughout most of the 2010s, which it later sold to Logitech in 2017. It’s been relatively quiet on the gaming front since then, but Skullcandy’s now back with a new lineup of headsets. There are three, ranging in price and functionality — each accented with a slightly different-looking printer color test page pattern on their sidearms (my interpretation, not Skullcandy’s). There’s the $59.99 wired SLYR, the $99.99 wired but more feature-packed SLYR Pro, and finally, the $129.99 PLYR wireless headset, pict…]]></summary>

Families are now grappling with inflation and a shortage of day care staff.
 On the Senate floor in early August, just two days before lawmakers voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, four senior Democrats came out to lament what they believed to be the bill’s biggest omission: child care.  
“We cannot simply vote on this package and call it a day,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) said. “Our child care system isn’t just stretched thin; it is broken.”
Less than two months later, the extent of that brokenness is clearer than ever. Public schools are fully reopened, and most pandemic-era restrictions are relaxed. But working conditions for families with kids who need child care are not back to normal. For both workers and parents, already-grim trends in child care ha…]]></summary>

The company is expanding Project Genesis’ coverage, but there are still basic features missing that make it clear the service isn’t for the general public.
 As soon as I got in my car, my Galaxy S22 connected to Dish’s brand new 5G network lost connection to the internet. I was a little surprised but not shocked — the service, Project Genesis, is only a few months old and only covers around a quarter of the US population. The service has always been a bit spotty on my side of Spokane, Washington, growing stronger and more reliable as you get closer to downtown. But as I drove laps around Riverside park, which was once my go-to testing area for the service, I grew increasingly confused — my phone no longer seemed to be connecting to any …]]></summary>

Sackett v. EPA may prove to be the most significant attack on America’s clean water laws since the 1970s.
 For decades, the Supreme Court struggled to define a key term at the heart of the Clean Water Act, the landmark 1972 legislation that forms the backbone of America’s efforts to “restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” 
It’s an admittedly difficult question, that is now in the hands of the most conservative Supreme Court since the 1930s. And the Court’s Republican-appointed supermajority seems poised to deal a severe blow to the clean water law, in a case that co…]]></summary>

While in the world of tennis, it's Serena Williams and Roger Federer, in cricket, it's legendary Indian pacer Jhulan Goswami who has put an end to her cricketing career. Goswami played her final international match for the country against England at Lord's on September 24, 2022. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, vice-captain and superstar opener Smriti Mandhana paid their tributes during her farewell as India women beat England by 16 runs in the 3rd and final ODI. Goswami also received a Guard of Honor from the England players as she walked out to bat one final time during the match. Taking to social media, she penned an emotional retirement post expressing her gratitude towards everyone who was a part of her journey. "To my cricket family and beyond. So, the day has finally arrived! Like every journey has an end, my cricket journey of over 20 years ends today as I announce my retirement from all forms Of cricket. As Ernest Hemingway said, `It is good to have an end to journey toward, but it is the journey that matters in the end. For me, this journey has been the most satisfying. It has been exhilarating, thrilling to say the least adventurous. I have had the honour of donning the India jersey for over two decades and serving my country to the best of my abilities. There is a sense of pride every time I hear the National Anthem before a match," she wrote. Here, we bring you pictures from Goswami's final match.]]></summary>

New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing crypto company Nexo, alleging that the company misled customers by saying it was registered to sell securities and commodities and that it wasn’t approved to offer services like its “Earn Interest Product” that promised returns on deposited crypto.

As Sony’s PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Digital Edition approach their second birthday, it seems that supplies of both next-gen consoles are finally catching up with demand (even with a new model reportedly on the way). Restock events are still the norm for snagging a console online, but things get a little more forgiving if you’re willing to visit a brick-and-mortar store, especially if you’re okay with paying a little more upfront for a bundle. What’s more, we’re beginning to see online stock stick around for several days if not longer, giving would-be buyers a better chance at securing Sony’s next-gen console without ever having to step foot outside the …]]></summary>

Melanie Lynskey will play a new character, in a new city
 Craig Mazin and HBO’s The Last of Us looks like it’ll largely stick to the story laid out in developer Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us, taking Joel and Ellie through a fungus-ravaged United States. But judging from the trailer, there’s at least one major exception: Melanie Lynskey.
Monday’s The Last of Us teaser trailer also served as a casting announcement for Yellowjackets star Melanie Lynskey in the HBO series. She’s playing a character named Kathleen, a “ruthless leader of a revolutionary movement in Kansas City,” an HBO representative told Polygon.

Populations are growing in coastal cities, which are vulnerable as sea levels rise and hurricanes drive larger storm surges.
 Hurricane Ian is barreling toward the Florida coast and is expected to reach Category 3 strength by Monday night, with winds reaching upward of 129 mph. Mandatory evacuations have already begun. 
But wind and rain alone aren’t what’s making Ian a threat; Florida’s population has been growing in recent years, with some of the largest increases in vulnerable coastal cities like Tampa and Miami. Forecasters are getting better at predicting hurricanes. However, these storms are capturing more people and property in their swaths of destruction…]]></summary>

Still on the hunt for a next-gen PlayStation 5? Right now, Sony is selling the disc-based PlayStation 5 with a digital copy of Guerrilla Games’ excellent Horizon Forbidden West for $549.99, which is $10 less than the cost if you were to buy the two individually. The best part? You don’t even have to wait in line in order to pick one up.
While we’ve been seeing Sony and other retailers offer stock for longer than usual recently, speed is still the name of the game here. We can’t suggest any hacks that will guarantee you’ll land the console today, but as detailed in our guide on how to buy a PS5, there are a few things you can do to improve your chance of securing one. For one, remember that you must log in with your PlayStation Network ID to buy a PlayStation 5 from Sony, so make sure you have your username and password ready. Also, be aware that you can only buy one console per account, so don’t waste time trying to buy more than one.




If you don’t manage to land a console today, be sure to check back in with us. Restock events such as this are not as rare as they once were, and we routinely call out stock whenever we see it at Amazon, Target, Best Buy, and other retailers.

In the meantime, it could be wise to start preparing for your new PS5 with some fun accessories and games. Here are a few we recommend:]]></summary>

Do Kwon, a co-founder of Terraform Labs, has insisted that he’s not on the run after the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, but Interpol is apparently under the impression he’s a fugitive. According to South Korean publication Yonhap and The New York Times, South Korean prosecutors said that Interpol has issued a “red notice” asking for help from worldwide law enforcement to find and arrest Kwon.
Interpol:
Red Notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.

Earlier this month, South Korea issued a warrant for the arrest of Kwon and five other individuals, and prosecutors believed they were all in Singapore as recently as September 14th. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office had asked Interpol to issue the red notice, saying that Kwon was “obviously on the run and has no intention to appear before us for questioning,” the Financial Times reported last Monday.
Kwon has publicly maintained that he isn’t trying to escape. On September 17th, Kwon tweeted that “I am not ‘on the run’ or anything similar.” Earlier this afternoon, after not tweeting for more than a week, he appeared on Twitter again, saying that he is “making zero effort to hide.” Given Interpol’s red notice, perhaps Kwon is trickier to find than he might be letting on.
Interpol’s press office said the organization does not comment on specific cases or individuals and that the “majority” of red notices aren’t made public. You can see which notices are public on Interpol’s website. Terraform Labs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hint: Water scarcity in the Western US has more to do with our diets than our lawns. 
 The Western United States is currently battling the most severe drought in thousands of years. A mix of bad water management policies and manmade climate change has created a situation where water supplies in Western reservoirs are so low, states are being forced to cut their water use. 
It’s not hard to find media coverage that focuses on the excesses of residential water use: long showers, swimming pools, lawn watering, at-home car washes. Or in the business sector, like irrigating golf courses or pumping water into hotel fountains in Las Vegas. 
But when a team of researchers looked at water use in the West, they uncovered a very different story about where most Western water goes. Only 14 percent of all water consumption in the Western US goes to residential, commercial, and industrial water use. So who’s really using up the water? Their findings may hold the solution to dwindling water supplies in the West.

But it was close
 The heroes of Marvel Comics are currently having some trouble with being harshly judged by an unstoppable space-god. And this week saw another long-anticipated development in the blockbuster event series AXE: Judgment Day. 
In May, Marvel Comics published its retailer solicitations for the month, including a brief description of Avengers #60, which stated: “Hawkeye must prove that he brings at least as much joy and usefulness to the world as a randomly chosen mailbox.”

There’s one last place in my life where the alerts, texts, pings, and emails, emails, emails! can’t find me: the shower. It is a sacred space where I process information, brainstorm, and sometimes, as a treat, anxiety-spiral over something dumb I said 15 years ago. But it has come to my attention that some of you are violating the sanctity of Shower Thought Time by actually inviting your phones into the shower. When this came to my attention, I did some digging and discovered dozens — dozens! — of waterproof phone mounts designed for the shower. Truly, I am shocked.

The right-to-repair enthusiasts at iFixit have published a video providing a screw-by-screw breakdown of the Apple Watch Ultra. The entire video serves less as a review of the capabilities of the Ultra and more of an intimate examination of the tech and engineering that goes into Apple’s powerful timepiece. 
iFixit’s breakdown exposed some vulnerabilities in the Apple Watch Ultra, not only in terms of its repairability but also its durability. The raised lip of the Ultra, which is intended to protect the screen, only really works against side-on impacts. As the video points out, any kind of head-on collision with the screen still risks a screen replacement. Getting to the battery on the Ultra r…]]></summary>

The game takes a novel approach to turn order
 In a role-playing game, initiative — that is, the order in which players and enemies take their turns — is one of the biggest factors in setting the tone, and the stakes, for combat. Traditionally, initiative order takes the form of a list that moves from top to bottom, activating player characters and enemies along the way, then resetting at the “top of the order” on the next turn.
But traditional initiative order can be a little boring. That’s especially true for a subset of RPGs known as dungeon-crawler board games. Like Diablo, this action-oriented genre of games, including titles like Gloomhaven and Descent: Legends of the Dark, empowers players to move quickly from fight to fight.

The news that Twitch will be reducing top streamers’ revenue share from 70 / 30 to 50 / 50 signals that the platform is no longer the ‘creator first’ entity that made it so popular.
 The reaction to the news that Twitch intends to change how it splits revenue with partnered streamers has been, on the whole, completely and utterly negative. Streamers at every level of growth, from the big-time partners to the smallest affiliates, were displeased to learn that the 70 / 30 revenue sharing split that had been long asked for — and is the standard or better elsewhere — was not only being rejected but being slowly phased out completely. To quote the Fallout 4 meme: “everyone disliked that.”

Meta is testing a new way to add and switch between your accounts on Instagram and Facebook by integrating its Accounts Center into the apps. The features should help make things easier for anyone who constantly bounces between various accounts on the two apps or people who have a lot of Instagram profiles to separate their Online Brand, personal life, and business.
The new account switcher for Facebook and Instagram will show you all the accounts and profiles you’ve added to the Accounts Center. While Instagram has let you switch between different profiles for years, the new system lets you throw Facebook accounts in the mix, making it easier to jump over to Facebook if you need to do something on that app. It’ll also show you some details about notifications for each…]]></summary>

I was one of the people who rushed to put down a deposit for Valve’s Steam Deck the first moment that I could. However, I pulled out of the queue after seeing how long others were having to wait near its launch. Now, after seeing time and time again that Valve has increased production of the Deck to shorten wait times, it eventually made me rejoin the queue, if only as an experiment to see how quickly I could get to the front of the line.
As it turns out, I only had to wait a month. I placed a deposit for the $529 256GB model on August 25th, and I just received my email confirmation that it was available for purchase. That wasn’t so bad. With a wait this short, there’s no reason to pay higher-than-retail costs for a Deck through sites like StockX or Craigslist unless you’re truly desperate.
Valve originally expected that some reservations wouldn’t be fulfilled until Q4 2022 or later, though the company is now confident that it will meet all of that demand by the end of 2022. That’s remarkable progress, especially since it recently expanded reservations to more regions, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. All the while, it’s been improving the Deck’s software and game compatibility.
So, if you’re thinking of gifting a Steam Deck to yourself or to some lucky person in your life for the holidays, putting down the required $5 deposit at this Steam page should give you a month (if not a little less time) to count up all of your pennies to make sure you have enough.]]></summary>

Substack’s the latest company trying to resurrect Google Reader from the dead — well, in spirit at least. 
Nearly a decade after Google’s popular RSS feed aggregator shut down, Substack has launched a desktop RSS client alternative: Substack Reader for the web.
Now, users can organize all of their Substack subscriptions in one webpage that they can view from their laptop or PC. The app also integrates with third-party RSS feeds so users can check out posts from other publications, too.
The new desktop client keeps old Google Reader users in mind with familiar keyboard shortcuts, for example, yet also sports new settings like dark mode.

Don’t Worry Darling features a Harry Styles love triangle, a possible feud, and maybe some spit. And that’s just behind the scenes! 
 Some people have sports. Some people garden or knit or birdwatch. And some people have the Don’t Worry Darling press tour. 
Personally, everything I’ve learned about the feature film — which stars Florence Pugh and should use a comma after “worry” in its title — has been against my will. I couldn’t tell you the plot (something about ’50s housewives?) but know all too much about the supposed behind-the-scenes drama, from the interviews to the non-interviews, the snubs and the Shia and the spit takes…]]></summary>

It’s a step toward Netflix’s ‘vision to build a world-class games studio’
 Netflix newest investment in video games is opening its first internal game development studio from the ground up, built for the streaming giant from the ground up. 
The new studio — the fourth games studio owned by Netflix — will be based in Helsinki, Finland, and will bolster Netflix’s efforts to bring “engaging original games” to their hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world, vice president of Netflix’s Game Studios said.
So far, the company has focused on buying pre-existing studios to invest in game development. The studio purchased another Helsinki-based studio called Next Games earlier this year, and previously acquired Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Boss Fight Entertainment.
The streaming service features a growing catalogue of games that subscribers can play at no additional cost with no ads on iOS and Android devices. Some highlights include the charming animated platformer Poinpy and Before Your Eyes, which you can literally play by blinking. Sam Barlow’s creepy film-fueled narrative adventure Immortality, will also be added to the streaming service soon.]]></summary>

Childbirth in Westeros remains no easy task, even after a time jump
 House of the Dragon’s sixth episode, “The Princess and the Queen,” was a particularly difficult one for almost everybody on the show. The series picked up 10 years after episode 5, and caught us up with its most important characters, many of whom had had a few kids in the interim. 
Among these characters was Laena Velaryon, daughter of Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen, and now Daemon Targaryen’s second wife. Viewers knew Laena best as the 12-year-old girl from episode 2 who spoke to Viserys about dragons before pitching him on marriage (which he politely declined). Laena and Daemon wound up having two children during the 10-year time jump, and Laena spends most of the sixth episode pre…]]></summary>

These are the droids you’re looking for
 No matter what you want out of Star Wars, we can all agree on one thing: It wouldn’t be the same without the droids.
Big droids, little droids, talkative droids, quiet droids — they’re all (mostly) good, in one way or another. But which are the best? That’s what we’re here to determine today.
We’ve surveyed the esteemed staff of Polygon, mining through the depths of Star Wars droid-dom to find the best and the brightest of our mechanical friends.

Instagram is testing home feeds without a shopping tab, marking a shift in how the platform treats e-commerce. 
Some Instagram users (including some of us here at The Verge) have noted in recent days that the shopping tab, previously on the bottom navigation bar, has been replaced with a notifications tab. Shopping, meanwhile, has been moved to a second menu, buried among options like settings and saved posts.
Meta spokesperson Anne Yeh confirmed the changes as part of a limited test.
“As part of our continued work to simplify your Instagram experience, we are testing a few changes to the main navigation bar at the bottom of the app with a small number of people,” Yeh says.

Gudetama is easily my favorite Sanrio character, mostly because it’s so relatable: just a little blob of egg who never wants to do anything. Same. In the upcoming Netflix series, dubbed Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure, we get a glimpse at how that might look in the real world. The show sees the egg teaming up with a little chick — who considers them “siblings” — as they leave the fridge into the big wide world. In the show, Gudetama looks much more realistic than its cartoon origins, but the attitude is the same; when it says, “Why bother trying?” I felt a deep connection.


The series starts streaming on December 13th, and the new trailer was a part of a series of Japan-centric announcements from its Tudum event, which also included details on season 2 of Way of the Househusband (it’s coming January 2023), a first look at Junji Ito Maniac: Japanese Tales of the Macabre, and a trailer for a new sci-fi anime called Moonrise. Elsewhere at Tudum, Netflix revealed new details on The Witcher season 3 and the prequel Blood Origin and showed off clips from Enola Holmes 2, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, and They Cloned Tyrone.]]></summary>

Threatening weather will force NASA to send the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket from its currently precarious position on the launchpad back to the Vehicle Assembly Building for safekeeping. The move will delay the agency’s highly anticipated launch of its Artemis I mission around the Moon.

Obviously, we had to rope together Polygon’s Splatoon 3 players to see what they were wearing. I just had to know. It’s important! (You guys should also send me pics of your Octolings and Inklings in the comments because I love seeing cool outfits. Thanks.)

Apropos of it being Monday, HBO’s dropped the first full-length trailer for its upcoming adaptation of The Last of Us, starring The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal as Joel and Game of Thrones’ Bella Ramsey as Ellie. To say that the trailer makes it seem like the show might be something of a banger would be an understatement.
Like Naughty Dog’s games, HBO’s The Last of Us from co-showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann tells the story of Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey), two people living in a world devastated by the outbreak of a deadly fungus that mutates those it infects into horrific monsters. Rather than focusing on the monsters themselves, The Last of Us’ trailer instead puts more energy into spotlighting just how much of its first season will feature Joel and Ellie keeping their wits about them as the world around them continues to go to hell. 
Based just on the handful of shots in the trailer, it’s difficult to say how The Last of Us will stack up to other zombie genre franchises built on the idea of zooming in on human drama during the apocalypse. But if the show ends up being anywhere near as unnerving and haunting as the games, HBO’s take on The Last of Us might be appointment watching when it hits HBO in 2023.]]></summary>

WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that allows users to share a direct link to a call, making it easier to stay in contact with your loved ones. The Call Links feature will start to appear on WhatsApp this week and can be accessed through a banner located at the top of the Calls tab. WhatsApp users who want to try the Call Link feature will need the latest version of the app.
Mark Zuckerberg announced the feature on Facebook, saying that WhatsApp users will be able to share a link to a call with “a single tap.” The ability to share a call link with up to 32 users was teased back in April during the announcement of another upcoming feature, WhatsApp Communities. 




The Call Links feature will support both audio and video calls, and Zuckerberg also confirmed that encrypted video calling is currently being tested for group calls with up to 32 people, which is notable, as WhatsApp currently caps video calls at eight users. 
Expanded call capacity sets up WhatsApp as a competitor for the likes of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. These rival offerings have a far greater caller capacity (100 for Google and Microsoft Teams and 300 for Zoom). However, they include restrictions like call duration for free accounts and might not be the first choice for the billions of people already chatting on WhatsApp. WhatsApp didn’t mention any restrictions on call duration, which could place it as one of the best free video calling applications for smaller teams and personal networks once the feature is widely available.]]></summary>

 HBO will soon have a new post-apocalyptic world as it premiered the first trailer for The Last of Us on Monday. The network announced the series’ premiere is coming in 2023.
The series is created by Craig Mazin, the creator and writer behind HBO’s Chernobyl.

The series is being developed and executive produced by Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog, the studio that developed both of The Last of Us video games. 
The Last of Us follows Joel and Ellie as they make their way through a post-apocalyptic United States that’s been ravaged by a mysterious disease that took over peoples’ brains and turned them into dangerous monsters. Along the way they meet all kinds of characters, some friendly, and others that are at least as dangerous as the infected they’re running from.

Following one of the biggest data breaches in Australian history, the government of Australia is planning to get stricter on requirements for disclosure of cyber attacks.
On Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Australian radio station 4BC that the government intended to overhaul privacy legislation so that any company suffering a data breach was required to share details with banks about customers who had potentially been affected to minimize fraud. Under current Australian privacy legislation, companies are prevented from sharing such details about their customers with third parties.
The policy announcement was made in the wake of a huge data breach last week, which affected Australia’s second-largest telecom company Optus. Hackers managed t…]]></summary>

After a year off, E3, the big gaming industry convention, is set to take place from June 13th through June 16th, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and event organizer ReedPop announced on Monday. The event will be back as an in-person show at the Los Angeles Convention Center, and there will be dedicated days for industry attendees and gaming fans to hit the show floor. E3 also plans to support digital gaming events that will take place beginning June 11th.
The “E3 Business Days” will be happening from June 13th through June 15th. These days of the show will be exclusively for games industry attendees for them to network, meet up, and go hands-on with upcoming games. The “E3 Gamer Days” are set for the last two days of the show, June 15th and June 16th, where general consumers will be able to try games and “connect with developers, content creators, media personalities, and more,” according to a press release. There will be specific areas cordoned off just for industry / business attendees, which could make it easier to facilitate meetings. GamesIndustry.biz has a few more specifics on what attendees can expect if you’re interested.
E3 didn’t happen in 2022. It was originally scheduled to take place as an online-only event but was eventually canceled outright. Gaming fans weren’t without a big June gaming extravaganza, though, as Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest filled the void with both a trailer-packed digital showcase and an in-person event for media and influencers.
Summer Game Fest will be back sometime in June as well, with digital and in-person components. With both E3 and Summer Game Fest happening next year, June is shaping up to have an absolute deluge of gaming news and announcements.]]></summary>

Tesla’s dealing with the aftermath of a fire on the grounds of its Gigafactory in Berlin early this morning. According to local reporting, Tesla’s factory fire brigade called for the assistance of local firefighters at 3:33AM, and more than 50 firefighters were involved in helping to extinguish a large burning pile of cardboard, paper, and wood (via Electrek).
The fire occurred on the northeastern side of the property near a recycling facility. Tesla reportedly has a contracted recycling company that shreds materials there, but the cause of the fire remains unknown.

You can have it in any color you want, as long as it’s green, red, or cream. Best Buy and Walmart are currently offering the green, red, or cream colorways of the 41mm Apple Watch Series 7 for its best price ever. The GPS and cellular-equipped configuration of the Series 7 is typically priced at $499 but is available for just $329. While Apple has everyone focused on the new Series 8, the Series 7 is still every bit the excellent Apple wearable we’ve come to expect. The Series 7 offers a larger screen than its predecessor, and it can charge faster than generations that came before it.

Airlines would have to refund passengers for services they paid for that aren’t actually provided, like broken Wi-Fi, under new rules proposed by the Biden administration. Also, airlines and travel search websites would have to disclose upfront any added fees for changing or canceling your flight and for checked or carry-on baggage.
The new rules are part of a slate of changes the US Department of Transportation is proposing to make flying more transparent and consumer-friendly after a particularly rocky summer travel season, in which flight cancellations spiked. The administration has previously sought stricter rules for passenger…]]></summary>

On September 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov saved the world.
 Editor’s note, September 26, 2022: This article has been updated to reflect recent nuclear tensions between the US and Russia.
On September 26, 1983, the planet came terrifyingly close to a nuclear holocaust.
The Soviet Union’s missile attack early warning system displayed, in large red letters, the word “LAUNCH”; a computer screen stated to the officer on duty, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, that it could say with “high reliability” that an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had been launched and was headed toward the Soviet Union. First, it was just one missile, but then …]]></summary>

 The slice-of-life superhero comedy comic Batman: Wayne Family Adventures will return for a second season this week, Polygon can exclusively reveal, courtesy of Webtoon and DC Comics. 
“Last season, we wanted to focus on the moments that make the Batfamily a family,” writer CRC Payne told Polygon via email. “This season, we’re going to dive deeper into these characters and explore what makes them heroes, both in the everyday sense and in the superhero sense.” 
For more from the Wayne Family creative team on their comic’s success, and a sneak peek at season 2 before it starts on Wednesday, read on!

Sanrio’s lazy egg is off to find their mother this December
 Gudetama the lazy egg is getting their own show on Netflix, and the streaming giant released the first trailer over the weekend as part of the Tudum fan event. Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure will premiere on the streaming service later this year, on Dec. 13.
Gudetama’s new Japanese-language Netflix series mixes real actors with CG. The trailer sees Gudetama team up with a tiny chick, Shakipiyo, on an adventure to find their mother — although Gudetama is obviously reluctant to do anything at all. 
The central conflict seems to be that Gudetama is reaching their expiration date and “going bad.” One of the human characters also vows to catch Gudetama, so it seems as if the lazy egg and Shakipiyo will spend some of their time on the run from humans.
Yuko Hara of the Southern All Stars will sing the Gudetama March theme song for the series.
For the uninitiated, Gudetama is a kawaii Japanese anime character created by Sanrio — the same company behind Hello Kitty. They’re an egg yolk with a constantly distressed face and what’s often referred to as “depression,” due to the modern world. They’re like if Winnie the Pooh’s Eeyore was a bright yellow egg instead of a stuffed donkey.
The show’s IMDB page suggests Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure’s first season will run for ten episodes.]]></summary>

Erica Lubman, an indie artist who goes by the moniker Boy Jr., is objectively good at TikTok. She has amassed more than 300,000 followers with her tongue-in-cheek songs and videos spoofing indie rock culture. Those followers have translated into ticket sales for live shows and millions of streams. But even when Lubman gets praise on videos that get half a million views — for her songwriting, for her humor — she is realistic about how fickle TikTok can be.
“I appreciate those comments a ton,” Lubman said. “But there’s a really good chance you won’t see another video from me for months because your TikTok algorithm is going to just show you other things and you’re gonna forget about me.”
On paper, it should be a golden age for music. Anyone with a song in their heart and a subscription to TuneCore can distribute their music on Spotify and other music streamers right alongside Beyoncé. And plenty are taking advantage of it — nearly 75,000 new songs are uploaded every day. So why, as research firm Luminate reported earlier this year, are consumers listening to less new music than before?


In part two of The Vergecast’s series on the future of music, I try to find out why it is so hard for new artists to break out. Speaking with industry experts, I explore the past 25 years of music streaming: from early warnings of the “celestial jukebox” to my personal golden age of music, the MySpace era, to the current boom and bust cycles of streaming today.]]></summary>

 When I reviewed the original Apple Watch SE in 2020, I was certain it was the best option for most people. In fact, my SE review was titled, “Just get the Apple Watch SE.” Back then, the always-on display was relatively new, the bigger screen with thinner bezels hadn’t arrived yet, and advanced features like EKG and blood oxygen monitoring weren’t need-to-haves for most people. (They still aren’t.) But things have changed since then. I no longer believe the SE is the best option for most people. And it’s not that the SE has gotten worse. It’s more that the SE’s role in the Apple Watch lineup has changed.

And there are likely more to come
 One of the challenges of adapting Fire & Blood is that the Game of Thrones prequel is more history book than novel, lacking much of the quirky character moments and meta fantasy jokes that are sprinkled throughout the A Song of Ice and Fire series. Thankfully, George R.R. Martin still finds ways to weave joyful surprises into the book’s detailed Targaryen history lessons.
There’s one particular tidbit from Fire & Blood that I’ve been dying to see make it to screen all season, and in House of the Dragon episode 6, it finally did. But if you weren’t already aware of this potential Easter egg and obsessively looking out for it, then you probably missed the fact that House of the Dragon just made a Muppets reference.

Customers of the consumer genetics and genealogy company Ancestry will soon be able to see which side of the family any DNA matches found through the service come from. The new feature, launching this week, builds on the SideView technology the company announced in April. 
“We’re really excited to see what users can do with this parental matches feature,” says  Caitlyn Bruns, a population geneticist at Ancestry. “I do think it will really help unlock an understanding of how you’re connected with your matches.”
The feature will let users more easily see where matches fall on their family tree. Previously, people could manually place people on one side of their family as they learned more about their matches. Now, it’ll happen automatically. 
The SideView technology leverages Ancestry’s enormous DNA database to sort which parts of a person’s genome came from each parent. When it first launched, it let users see which parts of their ethnicity came from each parent. Ancestry says SideView can have 95 percent precision for 90 percent of customers. 
Next, Ancestry plans to extend SideView to its communities feature, which connects people to groups of other users who might have descended from people who lived in the same area as their ancestors, Bruns says. It’ll group those communities by parental side. 
Once it goes live, this new DNA match feature will be available to users automatically when they log in to their account. 
“This is just something that we’re really excited about that that we can do with the size of our database and not something that other people are able to do at this point,” Bruns says.]]></summary>

Apple has started assembling the iPhone 14 in India, according to reports from TechCrunch and Bloomberg. This marks the first time Apple has shifted production from China to India this quickly after the launch of a new iPhone.
As noted by TechCrunch, Apple’s using Foxconn’s facilities in Sriperumbudur, India, to produce the device. While Apple has produced its flagship iPhones in India in the past, it’s typically done so well after the phone’s initial launch. The company only just started making the iPhone 13 in India in April, and it’s done the same with other models of the iPhone, including the iPhone 12 and 11. 
We first heard that Apple planned on closing the gap between the time it takes to switch production from China to India back in August, with Apple initially hoping to finish making the first iPhones in India in late October. A source familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Apple and Foxconn managed to smooth over supply chain issues, allowing Apple to move production to India faster.
“We’re excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. Apple didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.
Apple first started making iPhones in India in 2017 with the goal of decreasing the company’s reliance on China due to growing conflicts with the US. It also makes the devices more appealing to the Indian market, as locally producing the devices in India can make them more affordable in the country. According to TechCrunch, the standard iPhone 14 currently costs 79,900 rupees (about $980) in India, as opposed to the $799 price tag in the US.
Other companies, like Google, appear to be considering manufacturing hubs outside of China as well. Google is reportedly planning on shifting the production of its Pixel smartphone to India or Vietnam. Samsung has been making devices in the country since 2007 and opened up the world’s largest phone factory in India in 2018.]]></summary>

Michael Giacchino pays tribute to Hammer to Universal Monsters and Twilight Zone
 Attendees at the 2022 Fantastic Fest film festival in Austin, Texas were the first to see Marvel’s hour-long black-and-white Halloween special Werewolf by Night on Sunday night, at one of the film festival’s Secret Screenings. Director Michael Giacchino — the composer for The Batman, Thor: Love and Thunder, and Pixar’s Ratatouille, Up, Coco, The Incredibles, and Inside Out, among dozens of other films — called in for a remote Q&A after the screening to explain how the project, premiering on Disney Plus on Oct. 7, came about, and why it looks and feels so radically different from any other Marvel Studios project.

An AI firm is building Vader’s voice from Jones’ library of work
 James Earl Jones, the 91-year-old voice of Darth Vader (among many other noteworthy roles) is stepping back from Star Wars and his portray of the Dark Lord of the Sith. The news comes from Vanity Fair, which on Friday profiled a Ukrainian firm developing an AI that will continue voicing the character.
Jones has signed off on using his archived voice-over work to build the AI at Respeecher, the company hired by Lucasfilm to develop a voicing solution for Vader. “[Jones] had mentioned he was looking into winding down this particular character,” Matthew Wood, the Lucasfilm sound editor wo…]]></summary>

The City of London police report they’ve arrested a 17-year-old in Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking and said he remains in custody. In a follow-up tweet the next day, the police confirmed the teen has been charged with two counts of breach of bail conditions and two counts of computer misuse. A hearing was scheduled for Saturday, but as of Monday morning, no further details have been released.
Police declined to say what incident the arrest was in connection with, but many of the details line up with recent high-profile hacks. This spring, the City of London police arrested and released seven teenagers in connection with an investigation into the Lapsus$ hacking group.

The remastered rerelease of James Cameron’s Avatar is set to earn Disney an additional $30 million in global ticket sales since last week, ranking domestically in third place at the box office behind Don’t Worry Darling and The Woman King.
The 4K HDR version of Avatar was rereleased to theaters in the US on Friday, September 23rd, after the original 2009 movie was quietly pulled from Disney Plus in order to encourage people back to the theater and build hype for its upcoming sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water.

 The upcoming anime adaptation of Nier: Automata has not just one, but two new teaser trailers and a release date, seven months after it was first announced in February.
Revealed Saturday during the Aniplex Online Fest 2022 livestream, both trailers offer a first look at the adaptation’s version of 2B and 9S, two of the android protagonists of Nier: Automata who fight as soldiers in the elite military force YoRHa against an invasion of alien robots on behalf of humanity. 
Both trailers reveal that Yui Ishikawa and Natsuki Hanae, who provided the voices for 2B and 9S, respectively, in the original 2017 game, will reprise their roles in the anime.

 Intel took the desktop CPU performance crown last year with its Core i9-12900K processor. And now, nearly a year later, AMD is ready to trade blows again with its next-generation Ryzen Zen 4 CPUs. Fabbed on TSMC’s 5nm process node, AMD has promised big gains for its latest Ryzen 7000 chips over its previous Zen 3 (Ryzen 5000 series) desktop generation.
The flagship Ryzen 9 7950X chip is priced at $699 and features 16 cores, 32 threads, and a boost clock of up to 5.7GHz. We won’t be reviewing that flagship chip just yet, as AMD has only supplied the Ryzen 9 7900X in time for review, which ships with 12 cores, 24 threads, and a 5.6GHz boost for $549.

For 72 hours after it happened, Brian Chin hardly left the building. He didn’t sleep. He didn’t eat. He had arrived at 111 Chrystie, the 23-unit apartment complex his family owns in the heart of Chinatown, at a little before 6 a.m. on February 13 after getting a call from one of his tenants. It was a chaotic scene: The street in front of the building was blocked off, NYPD squad cars and officers everywhere. The police let Chin inside, but no one would tell him what was going on.

 Last year, I took the Amtrak from Chicago to San Francisco in coach, and loved it so much that I did it again. So this summer, I decided to take four more long-distance trains: San Francisco to Seattle, Seattle to Chicago, Chicago to New Orleans, and New Orleans to Los Angeles. (I flew from Los Angeles home to San Francisco because of timing issues, which is a big problem with US rail — something we’ll get into later.)
Along the way, I learned about America. I saw the quaint lakes of the Upper Midwest, the humid clouds of the Mississippi Delta, the breathtaking mountains of Montana, and the endless hills of West Texas. I saw beautiful sunsets in nort…]]></summary>

A fun little AI art widget named Text-to-Pokémon lets you plug in any name or description you like and (you guessed it) generate a Pokémon matching your prompt. 
The model’s output isn’t flawless, but it’s incredibly entertaining all the same. You can try punching in the names of celebrities or politicians (see “Boris Johnson” and “Vladimir Putin” in the image above), or just general descriptions of the sort of Pokémon that would tickle your personal fancy (the one below is my “skeleton priest”).
(A little tip for using the tool more efficiently: make sure you select “4” from the “num_outputs” drop down menu to get four images per prompt rather than just one.)

Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals has been delayed to 2023, its developer Night School Studio has announced.  “To make Oxenfree II truly special and add more localizations, we’re moving our release window to 2023,” the developer’s statement reads. “Thank you for your patience, support, and understanding. We can’t wait to share the game with you. Stay tuned!”
This is the second major delay to have hit the sequel to the acclaimed 2016 adventure horror game. Lost Signals was originally announced in 2021 and planned for release later that year. But just a few short months later the game’s developers announced a delay to “early 2022.” No specific reason was given for the delays beyond ensuring the game is “the experience we believe it should be.”
An update on OXENFREE II: Lost Signals pic.twitter.com/bEcwrvHUR9
— Night School Studio (@nightschoolers) September 24, 2022



Night School Studio was acquired by Netflix last year as part of the streaming service’s push into mobile gaming, and just days ago an iOS and Android port of the original 2016 Oxenfree was released. The title is now available at no additional cost to Netflix subscribers, with no ads or in-app purchases. 
Set five years after the original game, Oxenfree 2 follows new protagonist Riley as she returns to her hometown to investigate some mysterious radio signals that seem eerily similar to those from the original game. The game is currently scheduled to come out on Windows, Mac, PlayStation consoles, and the Nintendo Switch. Although a mobile version doesn’t appear to have been officially announced, we’d be very surprised if it didn’t also end up on iOS and Android since mobile gaming-focused Netflix is serving as its publisher.]]></summary>

When NASA smashes a spacecraft into an asteroid on Monday, people on Earth will get an extremely close look at the action. 
NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART) is headed for its final destination, the surface of an asteroid called Dimorphos, which it will crash into at speeds of over 14,000 miles per hour. Researchers are hoping that the collision will change the asteroid’s orbit, speeding it up just a tiny bit.

The Republican justices who overruled Roe v. Wade are only getting started.
 The headline of this piece is likely to turn a few heads. The Supreme Court’s last term, after all, was an orgy of conservative excess unlike any since the Court’s Great Depression-era attacks on the New Deal. And it culminated in the demise of Roe v. Wade, arguably the most closely watched Supreme Court decision since the justices declared school segregation unconstitutional in 1954.

Cameron Green and Tim David scored the bulk of runs as Australia put 186 for 7 after being invited to bat. Chasing the target 187, India won the match after impressive performances by Virat Kohli who scored 63 runs and Suryakumar Yadav who scored 69 runs at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad. The victory marked India's 21st T20I win in 2022 out of 28 matches. With this, Team India surpassed their arch-rivals Pakistan's record, who had previously held the record of 20 T20I wins in 2021. The victory against Australia also marked Rohit Sharma's 33rd win as India's T20I captain, putting him ahead of Kohli. The Indian team has had four captains in T20s this year with Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant leading the side. Post the win, Rohit shared a few pictures on social media and captioned it as, "CHARACTER 🇮�🇳�." India will next face South Africa in a three-match T20I series, beginning on September 28, 2022.]]></summary>

A guide to Rhaenyra, Alicent, and Daemon’s post-time jump children
 Time jumps are critical to how House of the Dragon is telling its story about a tumultuous moment in Targaryen history. None of those time jumps are as important as the 10-year leap  episode 6 takes. While much has changed in King’s Landing in the time the show skipped, one shift that has the potential to confuse audiences is the addition of so many new characters, in the form of the children of Alicent, Rhaenyra, and Daemon. 
To help you keep track of all six children that appeared this episode (including five new ones), here’s a breakdown of Rhaenyra and Alicent’s respective families:

And episode 6 was his coming-out party
 The sixth episode of House of the Dragon introduced an element to the show audiences had been expecting for a while: a big time jump. New actors have stepped in to play old roles, and a host of new characters have been introduced in the 10-year gap between episodes 5 and 6.
But the character whose role in the show increased the most in that time skip was present (and played by the same actor) before that 10-year gap: Larys Strong (portrayed by Matthew Needham). Who is he, and what’s his whole deal? We’re here to help, dear reader.

We’re now 10 years closer to all that fire and blood
 One creative decision has been looming over House of the Dragon since the August premiere of the show: A 10-year time jump right in the middle of the show’s first season, one that would mark new actors assuming the lead roles of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower. With a few exceptions — like those who play the children of Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), who are each portrayed by three sets of actors throughout the season — Rhaenyra and Alicent are the only two main cast members to swap performers after the time jump. This has made the mid-season decade leap forward feel unusually weighty — and for the most part, House of the Dragon does not make a big deal of it. 
This is in keeping with es…]]></summary>

If childbirth is a battle, then Targaryen mothers are war veterans. 
 Prior to the debut of House of the Dragon, co-showrunner Miguel Sapochnik told the Hollywood Reporter that the season would feature a number of childbirth scenes — all of which the creative team approached like “battles.”
By the time we reach episode six, “The Princess and the Queen,” said princess and said queen have each given birth at least three times. According to the show’s logic, then, Rhaenyra and Alicent are both war veterans.

What Putin’s troop surge can — and can’t — do in Ukraine.
 Russian President Vladimir Putin this week announced that 300,000 more men would need to fight in his increasingly difficult and costly war in Ukraine. But amid Ukrainian victories, major strategic and personnel problems in the Russian armed forces, and domestic frustrations over the mobilization announcement, whether Putin can accomplish his goals in Ukraine — and the nature of those goals at this stage — isn’t clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That poor Surface tablet.
    

  
Microsoft Surface tablets have been taking a beating at football events these past two weekends. During the Buffalo Bills game against the Miami Dolphins this afternoon, Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey took his frustration out on his tablet as the Dolphins secured a win during the final moments of the game.
Dorsey’s reaction may have been warranted, although he probably could’ve chosen another outlet for his anger (like a stress ball perhaps?). The Bills had a chance to run one more play to win the game, but the team ultimately ran out of time, losing to the Dolphins 19-21. When cameras turned to the booth where he was watching the game, Dorsey ripped off his headset and tossed his hat before he picked up the tablet and started violently slamming it against his desk. 
What an ending to the Bills-Dolphins game! #BUFvsMIA pic.twitter.com/yjlc3H0wUi
— NFL (@NFL) September 25, 2022



Last weekend, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady spiked a Surface tablet into the ground after his team made an incomplete pass when they faced off against the Saints. This temper tantrum even caught the eye of Microsoft Surface chief Panos Panay, who responded by saying “Rest assured the Surface should be just fine.”
Microsoft partnered with the NFL back in 2014 to replace the paper-based system of reviewing plays on the sidelines with Surface tablets. Since then, the tablets have seen abuse from Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Patriots coach Bill Belichick, and, of course, Tom Brady, who’s been caught tossing the tablet twice so far.]]></summary>

DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket hasn’t had a very good start to the football season. For the past two weekends in a row, subscribers have struggled to get their streams to work, and this weekend is no exception.
Even before today’s games started, users began complaining about numerous issues, with many saying that they can’t log into their accounts on the Sunday Ticket website or app and others having problems loading the streams. Those who are able to access the stream are reporting quality issues.
Somehow Sunday Ticket is acting worse than last week. Truly depressing. @DIRECTV
— Alex Reno (@alex_reno) September 25, 2022



DirecTV hasn’t issued any statement about whether it’s working to fix the stream, and the company didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. In a response to one user’s issue on Twitter, DirecTV said “we know some customers can’t access NFL Sunday Ticket online or through the app” and that its “teams are working to resolve this.” Aside from DirecTV, users trying to stream football through CBS on Paramount Plus are also reporting problems.
In what will probably come as a relief to football fans, DirecTV’s rights to NFL Sunday Ticket expire at the end of this football season. This leaves room for another company to snap up the rights to Sunday Ticket, with Apple, Amazon, Disney, and Google reportedly looking to air Sunday Ticket on each of their respective streaming services. 
So far, Amazon Prime Video’s showing of Thursday Night Football has shown some promise. The streamer’s first-ever live football game performed a heck of a ton better than DirecTV for the past few weeks, even with some minor blips here and there.]]></summary>

Apple could introduce a new naming scheme when it releases the iPhone 15 next year, replacing the current “Pro Max” branding with “Ultra.” This is according to Apple tracker Mark Gurman, who also expects the iPhone 15 to come with some “bigger changes,” including USB-C.
The Pro Max name first appeared with the iPhone 11 in 2019, and adding Ultra branding to the iPhone lineup wouldn’t be all that surprising. Apple already launched the new Watch Ultra with the moniker earlier this month, and added the name to its M1 Ultra processor. Apple also introduced a minor change to its naming scheme with the iPhone 14, bringing back the seemingly retired “Plus” name to the iPhone 14 Plus.

 Polygon is on the ground at the 2022 Fantastic Fest, reporting on new horror, sci-fi, cult, and action movies making their way to theaters and streaming. This review was published in conjunction with the film’s Fantastic Fest premiere.
Grim futures and hopeless circumstances are so common on screen that they’ve come to feel like the default mode for science fiction storytelling, particularly in low-budget movies. It’s hard for one crapsack world or future-fascist dystopia to stand out over all the others, when so many sci-fi stories expressly warn us about how every aspect of our lives could possibly lead us toward some sort of apocalypse.

Shooting action over 50? No problem for these stars
 In the crowded field of Netflix original programming vying for viewer attention, it’s difficult to stand out and be noticed. There has to be something that causes the endless scrolling to stop for a moment, for the potential viewer to linger on a title in hopes that it will intrigue enough to warrant a press of the play button — a hook.
The latest original film from the streaming giant, Lou, about a desperate mother’s attempt to rescue her kidnapped child from the wilderness with the aid of a mysterious hardened tracker, certainly has an intriguing hook. The grizzled hero with a mysterious past aiding the mother is portrayed by the unconventional choice of Allison Janney (I, Tonya). People might s…]]></summary>

Apple Pay Later is facing some “significant” setbacks that could delay its launch until next year, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The feature is Apple’s version of a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, letting you make a payment through Apple Pay and then pay it back in four installments without interest.
Apple said its Pay Later feature would arrive with iOS 16 when it first announced the program at WWDC in June. But now that iOS 16 is out, Apple Pay Later hasn’t made an appearance, and the fine print on Apple’s iOS 16 page vaguely says it’s “coming in a future update.” As Gurman points out, Apple Pay Later is the only unreleased iOS 16 feature on the page that doesn’t include a timeframe for when we might expect its rol…]]></summary>

 Spending a grip on a gaming laptop isn’t difficult; a cursory search on gaming laptops will net you several options that cost more than $4,000. But finding a laptop that’s giving you the greatest return on your investment is more of a challenge. If you’re spending around $3,000 on a gaming laptop like the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, you want it to bury the competition, not just scrape by. Unfortunately, the Triton 500 SE is a bit disappointing and doesn’t flex its hardware enough to set it apart in a crowded market. 
Housed in its all-silver chassis, the $2,999.99 configuration of the Triton 500 SE we tested includes a 12th Gen Core i9-12900H processor, RTX 3080 Ti graphics card, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of…]]></summary>

Difficulty sleeping can be attributed to a variety of factors and isn’t a reflection on how optimized or streamlined your life is. Shift work, children’s inconsistent sleep schedules, stress, bright light in the evening (from both home lighting fixtures and tech), the pandemic, …]]></summary>

Italy’s potential far-right turn is years in the making.
 Giorgia Meloni, the founder of the hard-right party Brothers of Italy, could soon become Italy’s first woman leader and the first far-right leader in decades, since the fall of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini during World War II.
Italy will hold snap general elections on Sunday to elect a new parliament, and Meloni’s party is widely considered the favorite to come out on top as the leading partner in a new conservative coalition, with Meloni as prime minister.

Big names like The Witcher, Knives Out, Enola Holmes, and Bridgerton all made appearances on the livestream
 For a second year in a row, Netflix held a livestreamed event called Tudum to show off some of its biggest upcoming movies, TV shows, and now games. (Though the names are the same, this Tudum has nothing to do with the struggling fansite also managed by Netflix.) There were a few notable absences from the 2022 edition — I’m still waiting to hear or see something about season 2 of Arcane — but there were also plenty of big names. That includes news about two different Witcher shows, trailers for Enola Holmes and Knives Out, and the surprise launch of an excellent indie game.

In Netflix’s upcoming sci-fi comedy feature The Cloned Tyrone from director Juel Taylor, everybody with even the slightest bit of common sense knows that Black people have plenty of reasons not to trust the government or the police stalking their neighborhoods. Some of those reasons, like police brutality and harassment, are obvious. But the real threat everyone’s facing in They Cloned Tyrone’s first trailer is a bit more hidden and insidious because it’s the sort of thing few people would be inclined to believe.
They Cloned Tyrone tells the story of Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris), Slick (Jamie Foxx), and Fontaine (John Boyega), three unlikely friends who are brought together by their shared discovery of a massive, secret governmental surveillance plan to monitor the lives of Black people before disappearing them and replacing them with clones. It’s hard to tell from They Cloned Tyrone’s trailer just what the end goal of snatching folks up is, or how three conspiracy theorists are supposed to take down that sort of operation on their own. But it does seem like They Cloned Tyrone’s going to have one hell of a good time reminding people what the concept of staying woke actually means when it hits Netflix on December 30th.]]></summary>

At the beginning of the month Netflix gave us our first taste of the first Knives Out sequel, and at its Tudum event the streamer showed off another clip — this one focused on some very complex puzzle boxes that double as a party invite. The brief clip showed off the mixture of humor and mystery that you’d expect from another Knives Out.
Glass Onion is an important movie for Netflix, and not just because it’s a centerpiece of the company’s holiday schedule. The company reportedly paid more than $400 million for two sequels to Rian Johnson’s original whodunit, and Glass Onion also features a star-studded cast including the likes of Janelle Monáe, Leslie Odom Jr., David Bautista, Jessica Henwick, Kathryn Hahn, Kate Hudson, and Edward Norton, alongside star Daniel Craig.
Knives Out is just one of several cinematic universes that Netflix is hoping to turn into its next big film franchise.
Glass Onion starts streaming on Netflix on December 23rd, and will be in select theaters before that. In the meantime, you can check out our spoiler-free review.]]></summary>

Fear not, Witcher fans: The prequel series Blood Origin arrives Christmas Day
 Netflix’s 2022 Tudum event gave fans updates on two upcoming projects in the Witcher universe. The third season of The Witcher, starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, will arrive in summer 2023. The limited series prequel spinoff The Witcher: Blood Origin, starring the incomparable Michelle Yeoh, will arrive on Netflix Christmas Day.
The poster for the third season of The Witcher shows a broken version of Geralt’s wolf medallion, and also features a small bird in the same style as the medallion.

In the poster for Blood Origin, we see a pair of arms holding weapons, forming an X. Both arms are tattooed with images of animals — the one holding an ax appears to have a wolf tattoo, while the arm with a shorter blade has a bird tattoo.
Season 2 of The Witcher opened with arguably the best episode the show’s ever had, and the long gap between seasons changed some plans and set up both season 3 and Blood Origin. We’ll have to wait a bit longer to see if season 3 can live up to that, but at least we’ll have Blood Origin in the meantime.]]></summary>

Yet another beloved indie game is now available on Netflix. At its Tudum event today, Netflix announced that the supernatural thriller Oxenfree, which first launched in 2016, is now playable through its fledgling games service. The Netflix version of Oxenfree is available as a free download to Netflix subscribers on both iOS and Android, and features subtitle support for more than 30 languages.
Netflix has steadily been adding excellent games like Into the Breach, Before Your Eyes, and Lucky Luna to its mobile gaming offerings, but Oxenfree is particularly notable because Netflix acquired its developer, Night School Studio, last year. Oxenfree also feels like a good fit for Netflix, with its focus on storytelling and a vibe that’ll appeal to Stranger Things fans. A sequel is also in the works.


Elsewhere, Netflix announced two games that will be launching on September 27th: Spongebob: Get Cooking and Desta: The Memories Between, which is developed by Monument Valley studio Ustwo. Other games listed as “coming soon” include a mobile version of the acclaimed Kentucky Route Zero and a baking game based on the Netflix series Nailed It.
Netflix started its foray into gaming late last year, though early reports suggest that it hasn’t caught on with the majority of subscribers yet.]]></summary>

When Netflix announced during last year’s Tudum that a third season of The Witcher was already on the way, there was some hope that maybe, just maybe Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia would be back on our screens slaying demons in time for the upcoming holiday season. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case, and there’s going to be a bit of a wait, but not an especially long one.
While there was no new footage from The Witcher’s third season shown at this year’s Tudum presentation, Cavill and co-stars Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan a made brief appearances to share some teaser art and to announce that the series will return in 2023. 
Taken at face value, there isn’t all that much to glean from the teaser art, which features the wolf, swallow, and obsidian star symbols associated with Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefir in Netflix’s adaptation of The Witcher. But the way Geralt’s wolf medallion — a powerful magic tool — is broken in the art could be a nod to how Geralt’s original medallion is destroyed in The Tower of the Swallow, the fourth novel in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher Saga. 
Netflix’s series, CD Projekt Red’s video games, and Sapkowski’s novels are all very different beasts. But it wouldn’t at all be surprising to see a rather major moment from the source material becoming one of The WItcher’s big season 3 plot points when it returns some time next summer.]]></summary>

While the third season of Netflix’s live-action Witcher series still doesn’t have an actual premiere date, the wait for Declan de Barra and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich’s upcoming The Witcher: Blood Origin prequel series is almost over.
Netflix’s The Witcher: Blood Origin hits Netflix on December 25th. And while we didn’t get a new trailer for the series — which tells the story of the very first witcher, long before Geralt’s iconic adventures — we did learn that Minnie Driver will be joining the cast, where she’ll star alongside the likes of Michelle Yeoh.
While you wait, you can check out the very first teaser for the series right here — and a brand new poster below.
Worlds will collide.

Once upon a time, it seemed as if Netflix’s upcoming stop-motion Pinocchio from co-directors Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson’s might in a bit of competition with Disney’s “live-action” spin on the classic story from Robert Zeemckis. But that all changed when del Toro stopped by Netflix’s annual Tudum event to give everyone a closer look into the labor-intensive, mesmerizing, and magical process that brought his Pinocchio to life.
In the new video, which features a number of different Pinocchio scenes in the midst of production, del Toro opens up a bit about what all he wanted to bring to his take on the fairytale, and why he insisted that the bulk of its animation was done by hand. 
While there’s also quite a bit of digital production involved in the film’s making, del Toro explained how the minute imperfections that come with hand-made stop motion art have a way of making stories like this feel more magical because they give you a sense of how the overall process works.
“I really wanted this movie to land in a way that had the expressiveness and the material nature of a handmade piece of animation — an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,” del Toro explains. “But it had the sophistication of movement that research in rigs and puppetry-making have taken us.”
 Pinocchio is set to hit Netflix on December 9th.]]></summary>

NASA called off its Artemis I launch scheduled for September 27th as Tropical Storm Ian continues to intensify, potentially strengthening into a major hurricane that strikes Florida next week. The agency still hasn’t decided whether to roll back the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket to the Kennedy Space Center’s Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) but indicates it will make a final decision on Sunday.

The unlikely hit premieres in November
 Manifest is back from the dead with the first trailer for its fourth and final season, this time with Netflix. The series is bringing back creator Jeff Rake for the new season, as well as its stars including Melissa Roxburgh, Josh Dallos, Athena Karkanis, and J.R. Ramirez. 
The first look at Manifest season 4 debuted during Netflix’s Tudum event on Saturday. The show’s final season will include 20 episodes, with the first batch arriving on Nov. 4. 
Manifest follows the passengers aboard an international flight that hits severe turbulence and has to be diverted. Though the plane lands safely, the passengers learn that they’re been gone for more than five years. Along with trying to piece their lives back together, the survivors also starts to experience strange voices and visions.
The series originally aired on NBC, but was canceled in 2021 after its third season. Manifest then made its way onto Netflix, where it quickly became the platform’s most watched series, reaching a whole new audience. This surge in popularity caused Netflix itself to pick up the rights to the series and greenlight this final season.]]></summary>

 Shadow and Bone season 2 won’t premiere on Netflix until 2023, but we finally got a small sneak peek of the upcoming season and AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
This new teaser is only 41 seconds long, but it’s filled with so much. For one, two fan favorite characters make their first appearances: Ravkan prince Nikolai Lanstov, as played by The OA’s Patrick Gibson, appears in the first moments of the teaser talking to Alina; later on in the clip, Jack Wolfe appears as Wylan — the sixth member of the Six of Crows, though canonically in the timeline he hasn’t really met the others yet. Also appearing are ruthless mercenaries Tamar and Tolya, played by Anna Leong Brophy (Traces) and Lewis Tan (Mortal Kombat) respectively. 
Of course, we also see Jessie Mei Li as Alina Starkov, powerful Sun Summoner, and Ben Barnes as the ruthless, yet captivating Darkling — along with the shadowy Six of Crows characters and everyone else from the first season. 
The second season of Shadow and Bone is expected to follow the events of the second book in the main trilogy, Storm and Siege. But like the first season of the show, the new batch of episodes will also incorporate characters not seen until later books in order to flesh out the storylines.]]></summary>

It’s tough being Sherlock Holmes’ little sister 
 Enola Holmes is back — and this time, she has a detective agency of her own. Netflix released the first trailer for the sequel, due out this November, at the company’s Tudum fan event.
As it turns out, trying to establish yourself as a private investigator is particularly tough when you are (1) a girl, (2) a teenager, and (3) the younger sister of the esteemed Sherlock Holmes. But Enola’s luck changes when a young factory girl brings her a case — the girl’s sister has been missing for a week and it’s up to Enola to solve the case. 
Enola Holmes 2 finds Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown reprising her role as the charming Enola. Henry Cavill once again plays a particularly hunky iteration of Sherlock Holmes, with Helena Bonham Carter as the Holmes’ siblings eccentric mother (in the first movie, The Hunger Games’ Sam Claflin played stuffy eldest brother Mycroft, but it’s not clear if he’s returning for this one). Additionally, Louis Partridge returns as Viscount Tewkesbury, the missing young lord from the first movie who strikes up a friendship with Enola.

 Splatsville is the heart of the Splatoon 3 community. The in-game hub functions like a social media platform where players can post art and messages tied to their characters. While these posts often riff on memes and make jokes about current events, I also noticed people sharing cryptic, but desperate messages like “INK BASE DAMMIT” and “ink home base, please!” This debate quickly took over my Twitter and TikTok feeds too, highlighting a debate over strategy in Splatoon.

Iran is in revolt.
 It was not an isolated incident of police violence in Iran. But the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last week has captured the country’s attention. 
Amini was visiting the capital of Tehran, coming from the Kurdish province in the country’s northwest, and Iran’s so-called morality police detained her, allegedly for wearing the mandatory headscarf improperly. Several hours after entering police custody, she was in a coma. She died two days later. Iranian police claimed she died after a stroke and suffering cardiac arrest, but witnesses say she died after sustain…]]></summary>

How a WWE wrestler, corrupt Mississippi officials, and Brett Favre allegedly siphoned money away from poor people.
 We live in an age of brazen, ham-handed grift. Have you heard the one involving the retired NFL star, a WWE wrestler, corrupt Southern officials, and the millions in welfare money that they benefited from? 
If you’ve heard about this scandal, it’s likely because of the involvement of former Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, specifically the $1 million in federal welfare money he received for talks he apparently did not give and the $5 million he was involved in directing toward construction of a volleyball stadium at the college his daught…]]></summary>

One of the best movies of the year is one of many leaving streaming this month
 Fall is finally upon us, and with it comes a whole season of movies to choose from. Before we can get to those, though, we have to pick out the very best of what’s streaming in September before they float away like so many leaves. 
We’ve got a fantastic crop of films to choose from in the form of David Prior’s 2020 breakout horror film The Empty Man, Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2, and Michael Bay’s action heist thriller Ambulance, not to mention classics like Alain Resnais’ avant-garde masterpiece Last Year at Marienbad, 1999’s The Mummy, and more.
Without further ado, here are 19 of the best movies to watch before they leave streaming in September.

Sony’s PC outreach continues with another PlayStation exclusive
 Step aside Peter Parker. It’s Miles Morales’ turn for a Windows PC port. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is coming to Windows PC and it got its first teaser trailer on Friday.  There’s no specific release date yet, but it’s scheduled to launch this fall. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is currently available on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The port will give Windows users the change to experience the glittering adventure for themselves. The teaser trailer shows Miles Morales in his sleek and shiny spider-suit, slinging webs and stomping bad guys to protect New York City.
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales features a lot of similar gameplay and locales as Insomniac Games’ 2018 hit Marvel’s Spider-Man. But it still delivers an original story starring Miles Morales in the hero’s role. In this 2020 adaptation, Peter Parker is out of town, so it’s up to Morales to keep the peace in New York. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not have a launch date, but players can wishlist it on Steam and the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

Sauron? Or just Some-guy-ron?

In the show’s third episode, we got another character to toss into the pile of Sauron Potentials. And then, in the fifth episode, that theory was uttered out loud.

No Church in the Wild director Romain Gavras brings the righteous fire
 Athena, the latest film from music video director Romain Gavras, is a one-trick pony, but that trick is so formally dazzling that the movie is an enrapturing experience. Composed of several lengthy, labyrinthine takes spaced out by traditionally edited scenes, it follows three French-Algerian brothers in Paris — young and middle-aged adults from different walks of life — thrown into disarray in the immediate aftermath of a harrowing family tragedy.
Their youngest sibling, a child named Idir, has been murdered, and the culprits caught on camera appear to be French police. The oldest brother, Moktar (Ouassini Embarek), is a drug and weapons trafficker who only looks out for…]]></summary>

While the show’s latest episode covers many different bases, perhaps its most interesting has to do with the history of mithril, a legendary elf, and the Misty Mountains themselves. 
[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power episode 5, “Partings.”]

 Rick Sanchez, the eccentric genius from the popular Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, will be the next playable character to join the roster of MultiVersus. We don’t have a release date yet, but publisher Warner Bros. Games says he will come to the game “soon.”

Suddenly, their battle is interrupted by the appearance of a green portal, with blue humanoid alien creatures called Mr. Meeseeks emerging from it. The trailer ends with Rick exiting the portal and letting out a giant belch.
Rick will be a “mage / ranged” character, according to his description on the game’s website. He is following his grandson Morty, who was added to MultiVersus in August as part of the season 1.01 patch.
MultiVersus is a free-to-play fighting game featuring a roster of fighters from various Warner Bros. properties. When he arrives, Rick Sanchez will join characters like Batman and Superman on the fighting stage. If you want to see who else you can play as, we have a full list of all current and upcoming characters.]]></summary>

Critically acclaimed Blades in the Dark is the startup company’s first full game
 Kicking off a new tabletop role-playing game with a small group of friends is hard. There’s getting six people’s schedules to line up bit, of course, which is always a chore. But learning a new game system requires study, and rolling up four or five new characters takes time. Game developer One More Multiverse wants to help, and it’s producing a set of tabletop tools to make playing with your friends online a lot easier. The venture capital-backed team is going at things very differently than its competitors. Whether you’re a potential newbie player or a long-suffering Dungeon Master, you should at least consider giving the demo a try.

Circumstances match other arrests linked to major breaches
 London police have arrested a teenager on suspicion of hacking offenses, authorities said on Friday. The 17-year-old suspect was arrested in Oxfordshire, England as part of an ongoing investigation with the government’s National Cyber Crime Unit. Police declined to confirm any other details regarding the arrest and investigation — just that the suspect is in custody.
That said, the circumstances follow earlier arrests connected to a hacker group that is said to be responsible for breaches at Uber and Rockstar Games, the latter of which led to leaked footage of the in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 published over the weekend.
On the evening of Thursday 22 September 2022, the City of London Police arre…]]></summary>

From the makers of Devil Daggers comes hell on hard mode  
 Y’all know what a palantír is, right?
For those neither versed in the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien nor the films of Peter Jackson, it’s one of those creepy, indestructible crystal balls scattered across the world of Middle-earth that allows the Eye of Sauron to warp the minds of any hapless fool of a Took (*cough* Pippin *cough*) unfortunate enough to steal a glance into its murky depths.
Playing Hyper Demon, the latest first-person shooter by Devil Daggers developer Sorath, is kind of like staring into one of those — but instead of mind-melting horrors, it has rocket jumps and a leaderboard.



Announced and released on Monday, Hyper Demon is not a sequel to Sorath’s aforementioned 2016 bullet-hell shooter, …]]></summary>

The series hasn’t missed a beat in its transition to half-hour television
 If you, like me, were terminally online around the early 2010s, you probably know, love, and have sorely missed Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared. 
Co-created by animators Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling, the six-episode web series set a fire across the Internet when it was released on YouTube between 2011 and 2015, with a unique blend of puppet-based antics and Lynchian shock humor. The animated shorts have since amassed over 216 million collective views on YouTube and inspired everything from elaborate fan theories involving Serbian war criminals to a small clothing line. Now, over six years since the last short, Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared has finally returned as a half-hour television seri…]]></summary>

New information from Splatoon 3 casts doubt on his record
 Splatoon 3 imagines an alternate world where ocean creatures, instead of mammals, took over the land. The game is set in a post-postapocalyptic world where humanity has been wiped out and sentient ocean life has taken its place. The signature character of the series, an Inkling, can take on both the form of a kid and a squid. There are a few exceptions to the game’s theme, however, including Li’l Judd, a cat who helps referee your matches. But now, a shadow of speculation has been cast on the adorable fuzzball due to new information revealed in Splatoon 3.

Dead Reckoning and 3,000 Scoundrels use clear cards to build replayable games
 Many board game publishers make a tidy profit on upgraded components — things like metal coins and card sleeves that make their products more appealing at the table. But some companies are building entire games around these kinds of bits. Just look at the poker-style chips and custom dice that Chip Theory Games uses, or the neoprene game board at the center of Leder Games’ Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile. This year, yet another rare and expensive component has had its breakout moment: clear plastic playing cards.

The river’s flow is down by about 20 percent, compared to the 1900s, and the two largest reservoirs it feeds are less than a third full. The water in Lake Mead, the nation’s biggest reservoir, has dropped more than 150 feet in the last two decades, leaving little water for the more than 40 million people who depend on the river.

Maw and Disorder puts Sylvanas on the stand
 Hearthstone is due for another mini-set, and while Blizzard has just left the Shadowlands behind for the next World of Warcraft expansion, the trading card game’s current expansion is Murder at Castle Nathria, a mystery murder set in the vampiric domain of Revendreth. A murder is usually followed by a trial, and that is the case here — the next mini-set is Maw and Disorder, and it’s themed around the trial of Sylvanas Windrunner.
Sylvanas was the main antagonist of World of Warcraft for some time, starting in the Battle for Azeroth expansion and concluding in Shadowlands. It looks like Hearthstone intends to take a significantly sillier take on her appearance; for instance, Sylvanas’ new Legendary card is revealed with a cheesy spinning newspaper reveal.
When she hits the stand, everyone will know. ‍⚖️

It doesn’t look like this is the same trial that Sylvanas faced in World of Warcraft either, where she stood in front of Tyrande Whisperwind and her former colleagues to admit fault for all of her war crimes. This time, it looks like Sylvanas is facing off against the Jailer, the end boss of Shadowlands, in court.
The mini-set will reveal of 35 new cards: four legendary, one epic, 14 rare, and 16 common cards. Players can either find these cards in Murder at Castle Nathria packs or as a Mini-Set bundle.]]></summary>
