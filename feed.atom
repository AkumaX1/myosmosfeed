A guide to Rhaenyra, Alicent, and Daemon’s post-time jump children
 Time jumps are critical to how House of the Dragon is telling its story about a tumultuous moment in Targaryen history. None of those time jumps are as important as the 10-year leap  episode 6 takes. While much has changed in King’s Landing in the time the show skipped, one shift that has the potential to confuse audiences is the addition of so many new characters, in the form of the children of Alicent, Rhaenyra, and Daemon. 
To help you keep track of all six children that appeared this episode (including five new ones), here’s a breakdown of Rhaenyra and Alicent’s respective families:

And episode 6 was his coming-out party
 The sixth episode of House of the Dragon introduced an element to the show audiences had been expecting for a while: a big time jump. New actors have stepped in to play old roles, and a host of new characters have been introduced in the 10-year gap between episodes 5 and 6.
But the character whose role in the show increased the most in that time skip was present (and played by the same actor) before that 10-year gap: Larys Strong (portrayed by Matthew Needham). Who is he, and what’s his whole deal? We’re here to help, dear reader.

We’re now 10 years closer to all that fire and blood
 One creative decision has been looming over House of the Dragon since the August premiere of the show: A 10-year time jump right in the middle of the show’s first season, one that would mark new actors assuming the lead roles of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower. With a few exceptions — like those who play the children of Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), who are each portrayed by three sets of actors throughout the season — Rhaenyra and Alicent are the only two main cast members to swap performers after the time jump. This has made the mid-season decade leap forward feel unusually weighty — and for the most part, House of the Dragon does not make a big deal of it. 
This is in keeping with es…]]></summary>

If childbirth is a battle, then Targaryen mothers are war veterans. 
 Prior to the debut of House of the Dragon, co-showrunner Miguel Sapochnik told the Hollywood Reporter that the season would feature a number of childbirth scenes — all of which the creative team approached like “battles.”
By the time we reach episode six, “The Princess and the Queen,” said princess and said queen have each given birth at least three times. According to the show’s logic, then, Rhaenyra and Alicent are both war veterans.
Note: This article contains spoilers for House of the Dragon, Episode 6, “The Princess and the Queen.”

Going back over the episodic time jumps in Westeros history
 House of the Dragon episode 6 takes a major 10-year time jump in the action — and however it plays out in the long run, it’s exactly the kind of move the show should be making.
One of the best parts of House of the Dragon, HBO’s so-far-so-good Game of Thrones prequel series, is how co-creator George R.R. Martin and showrunner Ryan Condal reaped storytelling philosophy from Netflix’s The Crown.

What Putin’s troop surge can — and can’t — do in Ukraine.
 Russian President Vladimir Putin this week announced that 300,000 more men would need to fight in his increasingly difficult and costly war in Ukraine. But amid Ukrainian victories, major strategic and personnel problems in the Russian armed forces, and domestic frustrations over the mobilization announcement, whether Putin can accomplish his goals in Ukraine — and the nature of those goals at this stage — isn’t clear.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That poor Surface tablet.
    

  
Microsoft Surface tablets have been taking a beating at football events these past two weekends. During the Buffalo Bills game against the Miami Dolphins this afternoon, Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey took his frustration out on his tablet as the Dolphins secured a win during the final moments of the game.
Dorsey’s reaction may have been warranted, although he probably could’ve chosen another outlet for his anger (like a stress ball perhaps?). The Bills had a chance to run one more play to win the game, but the team ultimately ran out of time, losing to the Dolphins 19-21. When cameras turned to the booth where he was watching the game, Dorsey ripped off his headset and tossed his hat before he picked up the tablet and started violently slamming it against his desk.

Last weekend, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady spiked a Surface tablet into the ground after his team made an incomplete pass when they faced off against the Saints. This temper tantrum even caught the eye of Microsoft Surface chief Panos Panay, who responded by saying “Rest assured the Surface should be just fine.”
Microsoft partnered with the NFL back in 2014 to replace the paper-based system of reviewing plays on the sidelines with Surface tablets. Since then, the tablets have seen abuse from Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Patriots coach Bill Belichick, and, of course, Tom Brady, who’s been caught tossing the tablet twice so far.]]></summary>

Dimorphos is a lump of space rock so far away from Earth that we don’t even know what it looks like — and on Monday, we’re going to smash it with a spacecraft. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will be traveling at more than 14,000 miles per hour when it hits the asteroid, in what has to be one of the most metal science experiments of all time. 
DART is a NASA effort to see if it can change an asteroid’s movement in space. It’s being billed as the world’s first “planetary defense test mission” —  a test run to see if we have what it takes to avert a serious asteroid impact on Earth sometime in the future. You know, just in case.

DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket hasn’t had a very good start to the football season. For the past two weekends in a row, subscribers have struggled to get their streams to work, and this weekend is no exception.
Even before today’s games started, users began complaining about numerous issues, with many saying that they can’t log into their accounts on the Sunday Ticket website or app and others having problems loading the streams. Those who are able to access the stream are reporting quality issues.
Somehow Sunday Ticket is acting worse than last week. Truly depressing. @DIRECTV
— Alex Reno (@alex_reno) September 25, 2022



DirecTV hasn’t issued any statement about whether it’s working to fix the stream, and the company didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. In a response to one user’s issue on Twitter, DirecTV said “we know some customers can’t access NFL Sunday Ticket online or through the app” and that its “teams are working to resolve this.” Aside from DirecTV, users trying to stream football through CBS on Paramount Plus are also reporting problems.
In what will probably come as a relief to football fans, DirecTV’s rights to NFL Sunday Ticket expire at the end of this football season. This leaves room for another company to snap up the rights to Sunday Ticket, with Apple, Amazon, Disney, and Google reportedly looking to air Sunday Ticket on each of their respective streaming services. 
So far, Amazon Prime Video’s showing of Thursday Night Football has shown some promise. The streamer’s first-ever live football game performed a heck of a ton better than DirecTV for the past few weeks, even with some minor blips here and there.]]></summary>

Shooting action over 50? No problem for these stars
 In the crowded field of Netflix original programming vying for viewer attention, it’s difficult to stand out and be noticed. There has to be something that causes the endless scrolling to stop for a moment, for the potential viewer to linger on a title in hopes that it will intrigue enough to warrant a press of the play button — a hook.
The latest original film from the streaming giant, Lou, about a desperate mother’s attempt to rescue her kidnapped child from the wilderness with the aid of a mysterious hardened tracker, certainly has an intriguing hook. The grizzled hero with a mysterious past aiding the mother is portrayed by the unconventional choice of Allison Janney (I, Tonya). People might s…]]></summary>

Apple Pay Later is facing some “significant” setbacks that could delay its launch until next year, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The feature is Apple’s version of a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, letting you make a payment through Apple Pay and then pay it back in four installments without interest.
Apple said its Pay Later feature would arrive with iOS 16 when it first announced the program at WWDC in June. But now that iOS 16 is out, Apple Pay Later hasn’t made an appearance, and the fine print on Apple’s iOS 16 page vaguely says it’s “coming in a future update.” As Gurman points out, Apple Pay Later is the only unreleased iOS 16 feature on the page that doesn’t include a timeframe for when we might expect its rol…]]></summary>

 Spending a grip on a gaming laptop isn’t difficult; a cursory search on gaming laptops will net you several options that cost more than $4,000. But finding a laptop that’s giving you the greatest return on your investment is more of a challenge. If you’re spending around $3,000 on a gaming laptop like the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, you want it to bury the competition, not just scrape by. Unfortunately, the Triton 500 SE is a bit disappointing and doesn’t flex its hardware enough to set it apart in a crowded market. 
Housed in its all-silver chassis, the $2,999.99 configuration of the Triton 500 SE we tested includes a 12th Gen Core i9-12900H processor, RTX 3080 Ti graphics card, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of…]]></summary>

The Witcher, Bridgerton, Outer Banks, You, Dead to Me, Chris Hemsworth’s Extraction 2, and more got dates, trailers, and/or cast announcements. Historical romance! Mysteries! Fantasy! Black comedies! Tudum is Netflix’s annual moment to flex, and if they proved anything, it’s that they’re in the works on options for literally every possible type of customer. 
Since the event lasted hours, we’ve rounded up the very best bits of news out of Tudum for your viewing pleasure. So click that skip intro button and scroll through.

Georgia, Nevada, and Wisconsin are some of the closest contests in the country. 
 The fight for control of the Senate is still extremely close. 
Currently, projections favor Democrats keeping the Senate, but Republicans still have a viable path. FiveThirtyEight’s model gives Democrats a roughly seven in 10 chance to hold on to the upper chamber. 
To expand their current 50-50 majority, Democrats would need to keep all of their existing seats and pick up at least one more, a challenge Republicans face if they want to retake the upper chamber as well. As of August, Democrats have just slightly surpassed Republicans in generic ballot polling.



According to the Cook Political Report, there are 10 Senate seats likely to be in play, including fou…]]></summary>

Sleep better without sacrificing your tech.
 If you’ve ever had a terrible, or even middling, night’s slumber — which studies and surveys suggest is a fair number of people — you’re well aware of the effects of poor sleep. Aside from the sluggishness and lethargy, lack of sufficient shut-eye can blunt thinking and reaction time and negatively impacts judgment. Long-term sleep deprivation has been linked with higher likelihoods of depressive moods, anxiety, diabetes, and obesity.
Difficulty sleeping can be attributed to a variety of factors and isn’t a reflection on how optimized or streamlined your life is. Shift work, children’s inconsistent sleep schedules, stress, bright light in the evening (from both home lighting fixtures and tech), the pandemic, …]]></summary>

An expert argues that we make parenting so much harder than it needs to be by failing at policy.
 Are we setting parents up to fail? 
Setting children up for success in today’s world is incredibly hard. In our culture, it’s especially difficult because the job of giving kids everything they need largely falls to parents. And even if you’re the most attentive and loving parent in the world, it’s not enough.

James Earl Jones has been the iconic voice of Darth Vader since the beginning of Star Wars, but at 91 years old, it seems he’s ready to have the work done for him.

Italy’s potential far-right turn is years in the making.
 Giorgia Meloni, the founder of the hard-right party Brothers of Italy, could soon become Italy’s first woman leader and the first far-right leader in decades, since the fall of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini during World War II.
Italy will hold snap general elections on Sunday to elect a new parliament, and Meloni’s party is widely considered the favorite to come out on top as the leading partner in a new conservative coalition, with Meloni as prime minister.

Big names like The Witcher, Knives Out, Enola Holmes, and Bridgerton all made appearances on the livestream
 For a second year in a row, Netflix held a livestreamed event called Tudum to show off some of its biggest upcoming movies, TV shows, and now games. (Though the names are the same, this Tudum has nothing to do with the struggling fansite also managed by Netflix.) There were a few notable absences from the 2022 edition — I’m still waiting to hear or see something about season 2 of Arcane — but there were also plenty of big names. That includes news about two different Witcher shows, trailers for Enola Holmes and Knives Out, and the surprise launch of an excellent indie game.

In Netflix’s upcoming sci-fi comedy feature The Cloned Tyrone from director Juel Taylor, everybody with even the slightest bit of common sense knows that Black people have plenty of reasons not to trust the government or the police stalking their neighborhoods. Some of those reasons, like police brutality and harassment, are obvious. But the real threat everyone’s facing in They Cloned Tyrone’s first trailer is a bit more hidden and insidious because it’s the sort of thing few people would be inclined to believe.
They Cloned Tyrone tells the story of Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris), Slick (Jamie Foxx), and Fontaine (John Boyega), three unlikely friends who are brought together by their shared discovery of a massive, secret governmental surveillance plan to monitor the lives of Black people before disappearing them and replacing them with clones. It’s hard to tell from They Cloned Tyrone’s trailer just what the end goal of snatching folks up is, or how three conspiracy theorists are supposed to take down that sort of operation on their own. But it does seem like They Cloned Tyrone’s going to have one hell of a good time reminding people what the concept of staying woke actually means when it hits Netflix on December 30th.]]></summary>

At the beginning of the month Netflix gave us our first taste of the first Knives Out sequel, and at its Tudum event the streamer showed off another clip — this one focused on some very complex puzzle boxes that double as a party invite. The brief clip showed off the mixture of humor and mystery that you’d expect from another Knives Out.
Glass Onion is an important movie for Netflix, and not just because it’s a centerpiece of the company’s holiday schedule. The company reportedly paid more than $400 million for two sequels to Rian Johnson’s original whodunit, and Glass Onion also features a star-studded cast including the likes of Janelle Monáe, Leslie Odom Jr., David Bautista, Jessica Henwick, Kathryn Hahn, Kate Hudson, and Edward Norton, alongside star Daniel Craig.
Knives Out is just one of several cinematic universes that Netflix is hoping to turn into its next big film franchise.
Glass Onion starts streaming on Netflix on December 23rd, and will be in select theaters before that. In the meantime, you can check out our spoiler-free review.]]></summary>

Fear not, Witcher fans: The prequel series Blood Origin arrives Christmas Day
 Netflix’s 2022 Tudum event gave fans updates on two upcoming projects in the Witcher universe. The third season of The Witcher, starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, will arrive in summer 2023. The limited series prequel spinoff The Witcher: Blood Origin, starring the incomparable Michelle Yeoh, will arrive on Netflix Christmas Day.
The poster for the third season of The Witcher shows a broken version of Geralt’s wolf medallion, and also features a small bird in the same style as the medallion.

In the poster for Blood Origin, we see a pair of arms holding weapons, forming an X. Both arms are tattooed with images of animals — the one holding an ax appears to have a wolf tattoo, while the arm with a shorter blade has a bird tattoo.
Season 2 of The Witcher opened with arguably the best episode the show’s ever had, and the long gap between seasons changed some plans and set up both season 3 and Blood Origin. We’ll have to wait a bit longer to see if season 3 can live up to that, but at least we’ll have Blood Origin in the meantime.]]></summary>

Yet another beloved indie game is now available on Netflix. At its Tudum event today, Netflix announced that the supernatural thriller Oxenfree, which first launched in 2016, is now playable through its fledgling games service. The Netflix version of Oxenfree is available as a free download to Netflix subscribers on both iOS and Android, and features subtitle support for more than 30 languages.
Netflix has steadily been adding excellent games like Into the Breach, Before Your Eyes, and Lucky Luna to its mobile gaming offerings, but Oxenfree is particularly notable because Netflix acquired its developer, Night School Studio, last year. Oxenfree also feels like a good fit for Netflix, with its focus on storytelling and a vibe that’ll appeal to Stranger Things fans. A sequel is also in the works.


Elsewhere, Netflix announced two games that will be launching on September 27th: Spongebob: Get Cooking and Desta: The Memories Between, which is developed by Monument Valley studio Ustwo. Other games listed as “coming soon” include a mobile version of the acclaimed Kentucky Route Zero and a baking game based on the Netflix series Nailed It.
Netflix started its foray into gaming late last year, though early reports suggest that it hasn’t caught on with the majority of subscribers yet.]]></summary>

When Netflix announced during last year’s Tudum that a third season of The Witcher was already on the way, there was some hope that maybe, just maybe Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia would be back on our screens slaying demons in time for the upcoming holiday season. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case, and there’s going to be a bit of a wait, but not an especially long one.
While there was no new footage from The Witcher’s third season shown at this year’s Tudum presentation, Cavill and co-stars Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan a made brief appearances to share some teaser art and to announce that the series will return in 2023. 
Taken at face value, there isn’t all that much to glean from the teaser art, which features the wolf, swallow, and obsidian star symbols associated with Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefir in Netflix’s adaptation of The Witcher. But the way Geralt’s wolf medallion — a powerful magic tool — is broken in the art could be a nod to how Geralt’s original medallion is destroyed in The Tower of the Swallow, the fourth novel in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher Saga. 
Netflix’s series, CD Projekt Red’s video games, and Sapkowski’s novels are all very different beasts. But it wouldn’t at all be surprising to see a rather major moment from the source material becoming one of The WItcher’s big season 3 plot points when it returns some time next summer.]]></summary>

While the third season of Netflix’s live-action Witcher series still doesn’t have an actual premiere date, the wait for Declan de Barra and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich’s upcoming The Witcher: Blood Origin prequel series is almost over.
Netflix’s The Witcher: Blood Origin hits Netflix on December 25th. And while we didn’t get a new trailer for the series — which tells the story of the very first witcher, long before Geralt’s iconic adventures — we did learn that Minnie Driver will be joining the cast, where she’ll star alongside the likes of Michelle Yeoh.
While you wait, you can check out the very first teaser for the series right here — and a brand new poster below.

Once upon a time, it seemed as if Netflix’s upcoming stop-motion Pinocchio from co-directors Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson’s might in a bit of competition with Disney’s “live-action” spin on the classic story from Robert Zeemckis. But that all changed when del Toro stopped by Netflix’s annual Tudum event to give everyone a closer look into the labor-intensive, mesmerizing, and magical process that brought his Pinocchio to life.
In the new video, which features a number of different Pinocchio scenes in the midst of production, del Toro opens up a bit about what all he wanted to bring to his take on the fairytale, and why he insisted that the bulk of its animation was done by hand. 
While there’s also quite a bit of digital production involved in the film’s making, del Toro explained how the minute imperfections that come with hand-made stop motion art have a way of making stories like this feel more magical because they give you a sense of how the overall process works.
“I really wanted this movie to land in a way that had the expressiveness and the material nature of a handmade piece of animation — an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,” del Toro explains. “But it had the sophistication of movement that research in rigs and puppetry-making have taken us.”
 Pinocchio is set to hit Netflix on December 9th.]]></summary>

The unlikely hit premieres in November
 Manifest is back from the dead with the first trailer for its fourth and final season, this time with Netflix. The series is bringing back creator Jeff Rake for the new season, as well as its stars including Melissa Roxburgh, Josh Dallos, Athena Karkanis, and J.R. Ramirez. 
The first look at Manifest season 4 debuted during Netflix’s Tudum event on Saturday. The show’s final season will include 20 episodes, with the first batch arriving on Nov. 4. 
Manifest follows the passengers aboard an international flight that hits severe turbulence and has to be diverted. Though the plane lands safely, the passengers learn that they’re been gone for more than five years. Along with trying to piece their lives back together, the survivors also starts to experience strange voices and visions.
The series originally aired on NBC, but was canceled in 2021 after its third season. Manifest then made its way onto Netflix, where it quickly became the platform’s most watched series, reaching a whole new audience. This surge in popularity caused Netflix itself to pick up the rights to the series and greenlight this final season.]]></summary>

This new teaser is only 41 seconds long, but it’s filled with so much. For one, two fan favorite characters make their first appearances: Ravkan prince Nikolai Lanstov, as played by The OA’s Patrick Gibson, appears in the first moments of the teaser talking to Alina; later on in the clip, Jack Wolfe appears as Wylan — the sixth member of the Six of Crows, though canonically in the timeline he hasn’t really met the others yet. Also appearing are ruthless mercenaries Tamar and Tolya, played by Anna Leong Brophy (Traces) and Lewis Tan (Mortal Kombat) respectively. 
Of course, we also see Jessie Mei Li as Alina Starkov, powerful Sun Summoner, and Ben Barnes as the ruthless, yet captivating Darkling — along with the shadowy Six of Crows characters and everyone else from the first season. 
The second season of Shadow and Bone is expected to follow the events of the second book in the main trilogy, Storm and Siege. But like the first season of the show, the new batch of episodes will also incorporate characters not seen until later books in order to flesh out the storylines.]]></summary>

It’s tough being Sherlock Holmes’ little sister 
 Enola Holmes is back — and this time, she has a detective agency of her own. Netflix released the first trailer for the sequel, due out this November, at the company’s Tudum fan event.
As it turns out, trying to establish yourself as a private investigator is particularly tough when you are (1) a girl, (2) a teenager, and (3) the younger sister of the esteemed Sherlock Holmes. But Enola’s luck changes when a young factory girl brings her a case — the girl’s sister has been missing for a week and it’s up to Enola to solve the case. 
Enola Holmes 2 finds Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown reprising her role as the charming Enola. Henry Cavill once again plays a particularly hunky iteration of Sherlock Holmes, with Helena Bonham Carter as the Holmes’ siblings eccentric mother (in the first movie, The Hunger Games’ Sam Claflin played stuffy eldest brother Mycroft, but it’s not clear if he’s returning for this one). Additionally, Louis Partridge returns as Viscount Tewkesbury, the missing young lord from the first movie who strikes up a friendship with Enola. 
Enola Holmes 2 hits Netflix on Nov. 4.]]></summary>

We got a professional player to weigh in on the debate
 Splatsville is the heart of the Splatoon 3 community. The in-game hub functions like a social media platform where players can post art and messages tied to their characters. While these posts often riff on memes and make jokes about current events, I also noticed people sharing cryptic, but desperate messages like “INK BASE DAMMIT” and “ink home base, please!” This debate quickly took over my Twitter and TikTok feeds too, highlighting a debate over strategy in Splatoon. How much ink should you spread on your side of the field?
In Splatoon you shoot ink instead of regular bullets. You can swim through your color ink easily, whereas the enemy’s ink will slow you down and make you more vulnerable to attacks. In …]]></summary>

Iran is in revolt.
 It was not an isolated incident of police violence in Iran. But the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last week has captured the country’s attention. 
Amini was visiting the capital of Tehran, coming from the Kurdish province in the country’s northwest, and Iran’s so-called morality police detained her, allegedly for wearing the mandatory headscarf improperly. Several hours after entering police custody, she was in a coma. She died two days later. Iranian police claimed she died after a stroke and suffering cardiac arrest, but witnesses say she died after sustain…]]></summary>

How a WWE wrestler, corrupt Mississippi officials, and Brett Favre allegedly siphoned money away from poor people.
 We live in an age of brazen, ham-handed grift. Have you heard the one involving the retired NFL star, a WWE wrestler, corrupt Southern officials, and the millions in welfare money that they benefited from? 
If you’ve heard about this scandal, it’s likely because of the involvement of former Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, specifically the $1 million in federal welfare money he received for talks he apparently did not give and the $5 million he was involved in directing toward construction of a volleyball stadium at the college his daught…]]></summary>

 Fall is finally upon us, and with it comes a whole season of movies to choose from. Before we can get to those, though, we have to pick out the very best of what’s streaming in September before they float away like so many leaves. 
We’ve got a fantastic crop of films to choose from in the form of David Prior’s 2020 breakout horror film The Empty Man, Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2, and Michael Bay’s action heist thriller Ambulance, not to mention classics like Alain Resnais’ avant-garde masterpiece Last Year at Marienbad, 1999’s The Mummy, and more.
Without further ado, here are 19 of the best movies to watch before they leave streaming in September.

His legal problems are worsening. But they might not take him down.
 Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: New developments have put Donald Trump in even more serious legal jeopardy.
A new civil fraud lawsuit from the New York attorney general’s office is threatening his business, while his efforts to stall the criminal investigation into whether he mishandled classified information seem to have failed. And a separate investigation into the January 6 attack scrutinizes his associates.
It all looks quite bad for him. Then again, for at least five years, much of the media has touted the seriousness of Trump’s legal peril, portraying…]]></summary>

 Giorgia Meloni and her far-right Fratelli d’Italia are expected to lead a far right victory in Italian elections this weekend. That win, if it happens, would come shortly after the far-right Sweden Democrats won the second-largest share of the vote, helping to oust the center-left from power and giving the far right a potential role in the next government.

The filter called “AR Klee” has been used in videos more than 257,000 times with simple TikToks showing the character dancing garnering as many as 6.4 million views.

The record-breaking anime feature finally comes to streaming this week
 This weekend sees the premiere of Athena, the explosive French thriller epic from acclaimed music video director Romain Gavras on Netflix, as well as the highly anticipated streaming premiere of the record-breaking Jujutsu Kaisen 0 anime film on Crunchyroll. If neither of those strike your fancy, not to worry — this week is practically bursting at the seams with exciting new movies to stream and rent on VOD.
We’ve got the action thriller Lou starring Allison Janney (The West Wing) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country) and the Tyler Perry-directed period romance drama A Jazzman’s Blues on Netflix, the time-hopping romance comedy Meet Cute on Peacock, the Oprah Winfrey-produced Sidney Poitier…]]></summary>

Sony’s PC outreach continues with another PlayStation exclusive
 Step aside Peter Parker. It’s Miles Morales’ turn for a Windows PC port. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is coming to Windows PC and it got its first teaser trailer on Friday.  There’s no specific release date yet, but it’s scheduled to launch this fall. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is currently available on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The port will give Windows users the change to experience the glittering adventure for themselves. The teaser trailer shows Miles Morales in his sleek and shiny spider-suit, slinging webs and stomping bad guys to protect New York City.
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales features a lot of similar gameplay and locales as Insomniac Games’ 2018 hit Marvel’s Spider-Man. But it still delivers an original story starring Miles Morales in the hero’s role. In this 2020 adaptation, Peter Parker is out of town, so it’s up to Morales to keep the peace in New York. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not have a launch date, but players can wishlist it on Steam and the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

No Church in the Wild director Romain Gavras brings the righteous fire
 Athena, the latest film from music video director Romain Gavras, is a one-trick pony, but that trick is so formally dazzling that the movie is an enrapturing experience. Composed of several lengthy, labyrinthine takes spaced out by traditionally edited scenes, it follows three French-Algerian brothers in Paris — young and middle-aged adults from different walks of life — thrown into disarray in the immediate aftermath of a harrowing family tragedy.
Their youngest sibling, a child named Idir, has been murdered, and the culprits caught on camera appear to be French police. The oldest brother, Moktar (Ouassini Embarek), is a drug and weapons trafficker who only looks out for…]]></summary>

Amazon’s show adds a new legend to Tolkien’s legendarium
 Despite its status as a prequel, Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power still has plenty to teach us about the history of Middle-earth, or at least its version of that history. While the show’s latest episode covers many different bases, perhaps its most interesting has to do with the history of mithril, a legendary elf, and the Misty Mountains themselves. 
[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power episode 5, “Partings.”]

He’ll be joining his grandson Morty 
 Rick Sanchez, the eccentric genius from the popular Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, will be the next playable character to join the roster of MultiVersus. We don’t have a release date yet, but publisher Warner Bros. Games says he will come to the game “soon.”
You can catch a glimpse of Rick in a teaser trailer that was released Friday. The match starts off with a fight between Wonder Woman and Reindog. Suddenly, their battle is interrupted by the appearance of a green portal, with blue humanoid alien creatures called Mr. Meeseeks emerging from it. The trailer ends with Rick exiting the portal and letting out a giant belch.
Rick will be a “mage / ranged” character, according to his description on the game’s website. He is following his grandson Morty, who was added to MultiVersus in August as part of the season 1.01 patch.
MultiVersus is a free-to-play fighting game featuring a roster of fighters from various Warner Bros. properties. When he arrives, Rick Sanchez will join characters like Batman and Superman on the fighting stage. If you want to see who else you can play as, we have a full list of all current and upcoming characters.]]></summary>

 Kicking off a new tabletop role-playing game with a small group of friends is hard. There’s getting six people’s schedules to line up bit, of course, which is always a chore. But learning a new game system requires study, and rolling up four or five new characters takes time. Game developer One More Multiverse wants to help, and it’s producing a set of tabletop tools to make playing with your friends online a lot easier. The venture capital-backed team is going at things very differently than its competitors. Whether you’re a potential newbie player or a long-suffering Dungeon Master, you should at least consider giving the demo a try.

Circumstances match other arrests linked to major breaches
 London police have arrested a teenager on suspicion of hacking offenses, authorities said on Friday. The 17-year-old suspect was arrested in Oxfordshire, England as part of an ongoing investigation with the government’s National Cyber Crime Unit. Police declined to confirm any other details regarding the arrest and investigation — just that the suspect is in custody.
That said, the circumstances follow earlier arrests connected to a hacker group that is said to be responsible for breaches at Uber and Rockstar Games, the latter of which led to leaked footage of the in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 published over the weekend.

 Y’all know what a palantír is, right?
For those neither versed in the writings of J.R.R.

Playing Hyper Demon, the latest first-person shooter by Devil Daggers developer Sorath, is kind of like staring into one of those — but instead of mind-melting horrors, it has rocket jumps and a leaderboard.

The series hasn’t missed a beat in its transition to half-hour television
 If you, like me, were terminally online around the early 2010s, you probably know, love, and have sorely missed Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared. 
Co-created by animators Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling, the six-episode web series set a fire across the Internet when it was released on YouTube between 2011 and 2015, with a unique blend of puppet-based antics and Lynchian shock humor. The animated shorts have since amassed over 216 million collective views on YouTube and inspired everything from elaborate fan theories involving Serbian war criminals to a small clothing line. Now, over six years since the last short, Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared has finally returned as a half-hour television seri…]]></summary>

New information from Splatoon 3 casts doubt on his record
 Splatoon 3 imagines an alternate world where ocean creatures, instead of mammals, took over the land. The game is set in a post-postapocalyptic world where humanity has been wiped out and sentient ocean life has taken its place. The signature character of the series, an Inkling, can take on both the form of a kid and a squid. There are a few exceptions to the game’s theme, however, including Li’l Judd, a cat who helps referee your matches. But now, a shadow of speculation has been cast on the adorable fuzzball due to new information revealed in Splatoon 3. 
Although the Splatoon series is primarily known for being a competitive online shooter, the developers manage to pack in extensive lore arou…]]></summary>

Dead Reckoning and 3,000 Scoundrels use clear cards to build replayable games
 Many board game publishers make a tidy profit on upgraded components — things like metal coins and card sleeves that make their products more appealing at the table. But some companies are building entire games around these kinds of bits. Just look at the poker-style chips and custom dice that Chip Theory Games uses, or the neoprene game board at the center of Leder Games’ Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile. This year, yet another rare and expensive component has had its breakout moment: clear plastic playing cards.
These unusual transparent sheets feel just like regular playing cards. You can shuffle them and you can sleeve them, so they seamlessly integrate into deck…]]></summary>

The river’s flow is down by about 20 percent, compared to the 1900s, and the two largest reservoirs it feeds are less than a third full. The water in Lake Mead, the nation’s biggest reservoir, has dropped more than 150 feet in the last two decades, leaving little water for the more than 40 million people who depend on the river.

House Democrats used a recent vote to show voters they are for the police. 
 On Thursday, House Democrats passed a package of bills intended to blunt the GOP broadsides they’ve faced on crime, seeking to dispel any perceptions that they want to “defund the police” amid growing worries about public safety. 
Democrats tried to strike a delicate balance with this package: While it includes more grant money for police, it also contains bills that would invest in reform efforts activists favor such as community-based violence interventions and first responders who are trained specifically to address mental…]]></summary>

Maw and Disorder puts Sylvanas on the stand
 Hearthstone is due for another mini-set, and while Blizzard has just left the Shadowlands behind for the next World of Warcraft expansion, the trading card game’s current expansion is Murder at Castle Nathria, a mystery murder set in the vampiric domain of Revendreth. A murder is usually followed by a trial, and that is the case here — the next mini-set is Maw and Disorder, and it’s themed around the trial of Sylvanas Windrunner.
Sylvanas was the main antagonist of World of Warcraft for some time, starting in the Battle for Azeroth expansion and concluding in Shadowlands. It looks like Hearthstone intends to take a significantly sillier take on her appearance; for instance, Sylvanas’ new Legendary card is revealed with a cheesy spinning newspaper reveal.
When she hits the stand, everyone will know. ‍⚖️

— Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) September 22, 2022



It doesn’t look like this is the same trial that Sylvanas faced in World of Warcraft either, where she stood in front of Tyrande Whisperwind and her former colleagues to admit fault for all of her war crimes. This time, it looks like Sylvanas is facing off against the Jailer, the end boss of Shadowlands, in court.
The mini-set will reveal of 35 new cards: four legendary, one epic, 14 rare, and 16 common cards. Players can either find these cards in Murder at Castle Nathria packs or as a Mini-Set bundle.]]></summary>
