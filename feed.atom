But it was close
 The heroes of Marvel Comics are currently having some trouble with being harshly judged by an unstoppable space-god. And this week saw another long-anticipated development in the blockbuster event series AXE: Judgment Day. 
In May, Marvel Comics published its retailer solicitations for the month, including a brief description of Avengers #60, which stated: “Hawkeye must prove that he brings at least as much joy and usefulness to the world as a randomly chosen mailbox.” 
In regard to which I had only one thing to say: “God, I hope that’s meant literally.” Now, we finally know the answer.
What else is happening in the pages of our favorite comics? We’ll tell you. Welcome to Monday Funnies, Polygon’s weekly …]]></summary>

There’s one last place in my life where the alerts, texts, pings, and emails, emails, emails! can’t find me: the shower. It is a sacred space where I process information, brainstorm, and sometimes, as a treat, anxiety-spiral over something dumb I said 15 years ago. But it has come to my attention that some of you are violating the sanctity of Shower Thought Time by actually inviting your phones into the shower. When this came to my attention, I did some digging and discovered dozens — dozens! — of waterproof phone mounts designed for the shower. Truly, I am shocked. You guys are bringing your phones into the shower?

The right-to-repair enthusiasts at iFixit have published a video providing a screw-by-screw breakdown of the Apple Watch Ultra. The entire video serves less as a review of the capabilities of the Ultra and more of an intimate examination of the tech and engineering that goes into Apple’s powerful timepiece. 
iFixit’s breakdown exposed some vulnerabilities in the Apple Watch Ultra, not only in terms of its repairability but also its durability. The raised lip of the Ultra, which is intended to protect the screen, only really works against side-on impacts. As the video points out, any kind of head-on collision with the screen still risks a screen replacement. Getting to the battery on the Ultra r…]]></summary>

The game takes a novel approach to turn order
 In a role-playing game, initiative — that is, the order in which players and enemies take their turns — is one of the biggest factors in setting the tone, and the stakes, for combat. Traditionally, initiative order takes the form of a list that moves from top to bottom, activating player characters and enemies along the way, then resetting at the “top of the order” on the next turn.
But traditional initiative order can be a little boring. That’s especially true for a subset of RPGs known as dungeon-crawler board games. Like Diablo, this action-oriented genre of games, including titles like Gloomhaven and Descent: Legends of the Dark, empowers players to move quickly from fight to fight. Combat can be high-…]]></summary>

The news that Twitch will be reducing top streamers’ revenue share from 70 / 30 to 50 / 50 signals that the platform is no longer the ‘creator first’ entity that made it so popular.
 The reaction to the news that Twitch intends to change how it splits revenue with partnered streamers has been, on the whole, completely and utterly negative. Streamers at every level of growth, from the big-time partners to the smallest affiliates, were displeased to learn that the 70 / 30 revenue sharing split that had been long asked for — and is the standard or better elsewhere — was not only being rejected but being slowly phased out completely. To quote the Fallout 4 meme: “everyone disliked that.”

The new account switcher for Facebook and Instagram will show you all the accounts and profiles you’ve added to the Accounts Center. While Instagram has let you switch between different profiles for years, the new system lets you throw Facebook accounts in the mix, making it easier to jump over to Facebook if you need to do something on that app. It’ll also show you some details about notifications for each…]]></summary>

I was one of the people who rushed to put down a deposit for Valve’s Steam Deck the first moment that I could. However, I pulled out of the queue after seeing how long others were having to wait near its launch. Now, after seeing time and time again that Valve has increased production of the Deck to shorten wait times, it eventually made me rejoin the queue, if only as an experiment to see how quickly I could get to the front of the line.
As it turns out, I only had to wait a month. I placed a deposit for the $529 256GB model on August 25th, and I just received my email confirmation that it was available for purchase. That wasn’t so bad. With a wait this short, there’s no reason to pay higher-than-retail costs for a Deck through sites like StockX or Craigslist unless you’re truly desperate.
Valve originally expected that some reservations wouldn’t be fulfilled until Q4 2022 or later, though the company is now confident that it will meet all of that demand by the end of 2022. That’s remarkable progress, especially since it recently expanded reservations to more regions, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. All the while, it’s been improving the Deck’s software and game compatibility.
So, if you’re thinking of gifting a Steam Deck to yourself or to some lucky person in your life for the holidays, putting down the required $5 deposit at this Steam page should give you a month (if not a little less time) to count up all of your pennies to make sure you have enough.]]></summary>

Substack’s the latest company trying to resurrect Google Reader from the dead — well, in spirit at least. 
Nearly a decade after Google’s popular RSS feed aggregator shut down, Substack has launched a desktop RSS client alternative: Substack Reader for the web.
Now, users can organize all of their Substack subscriptions in one webpage that they can view from their laptop or PC. The app also integrates with third-party RSS feeds so users can check out posts from other publications, too.
The new desktop client keeps old Google Reader users in mind with familiar keyboard shortcuts, for example, yet also sports new settings like dark mode.

Don’t Worry Darling features a Harry Styles love triangle, a possible feud, and maybe some spit. And that’s just behind the scenes! 
 Some people have sports. Some people garden or knit or birdwatch. And some people have the Don’t Worry Darling press tour. 
Personally, everything I’ve learned about the feature film — which stars Florence Pugh and should use a comma after “worry” in its title — has been against my will. I couldn’t tell you the plot (something about ’50s housewives?) but know all too much about the supposed behind-the-scenes drama, from the interviews to the non-interviews, the snubs and the Shia and the spit takes…]]></summary>

It’s a step toward Netflix’s ‘vision to build a world-class games studio’
 Netflix newest investment in video games is opening its first internal game development studio from the ground up, built for the streaming giant from the ground up. 
The new studio — the fourth games studio owned by Netflix — will be based in Helsinki, Finland, and will bolster Netflix’s efforts to bring “engaging original games” to their hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world, vice president of Netflix’s Game Studios said.
So far, the company has focused on buying pre-existing studios to invest in game development. The studio purchased another Helsinki-based studio called Next Games earlier this year, and previously acquired Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Boss Fight Entertainment.
The streaming service features a growing catalogue of games that subscribers can play at no additional cost with no ads on iOS and Android devices. Some highlights include the charming animated platformer Poinpy and Before Your Eyes, which you can literally play by blinking. Sam Barlow’s creepy film-fueled narrative adventure Immortality, will also be added to the streaming service soon.]]></summary>

Childbirth in Westeros remains no easy task, even after a time jump
 House of the Dragon’s sixth episode, “The Princess and the Queen,” was a particularly difficult one for almost everybody on the show. The series picked up 10 years after episode 5, and caught us up with its most important characters, many of whom had had a few kids in the interim. 
Among these characters was Laena Velaryon, daughter of Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen, and now Daemon Targaryen’s second wife. Viewers knew Laena best as the 12-year-old girl from episode 2 who spoke to Viserys about dragons before pitching him on marriage (which he politely declined). Laena and Daemon wound up having two children during the 10-year time jump, and Laena spends most of the sixth episode pre…]]></summary>

These are the droids you’re looking for
 No matter what you want out of Star Wars, we can all agree on one thing: It wouldn’t be the same without the droids.
Big droids, little droids, talkative droids, quiet droids — they’re all (mostly) good, in one way or another. But which are the best? That’s what we’re here to determine today.
We’ve surveyed the esteemed staff of Polygon, mining through the depths of Star Wars droid-dom to find the best and the brightest of our mechanical friends.

Instagram is testing home feeds without a shopping tab, marking a shift in how the platform treats e-commerce. 
Some Instagram users (including some of us here at The Verge) have noted in recent days that the shopping tab, previously on the bottom navigation bar, has been replaced with a notifications tab. Shopping, meanwhile, has been moved to a second menu, buried among options like settings and saved posts.
Meta spokesperson Anne Yeh confirmed the changes as part of a limited test.
“As part of our continued work to simplify your Instagram experience, we are testing a few changes to the main navigation bar at the bottom of the app with a small number of people,” Yeh says.

Gudetama is easily my favorite Sanrio character, mostly because it’s so relatable: just a little blob of egg who never wants to do anything. Same. In the upcoming Netflix series, dubbed Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure, we get a glimpse at how that might look in the real world. The show sees the egg teaming up with a little chick — who considers them “siblings” — as they leave the fridge into the big wide world. In the show, Gudetama looks much more realistic than its cartoon origins, but the attitude is the same; when it says, “Why bother trying?” I felt a deep connection.


The series starts streaming on December 13th, and the new trailer was a part of a series of Japan-centric announcements from its Tudum event, which also included details on season 2 of Way of the Househusband (it’s coming January 2023), a first look at Junji Ito Maniac: Japanese Tales of the Macabre, and a trailer for a new sci-fi anime called Moonrise. Elsewhere at Tudum, Netflix revealed new details on The Witcher season 3 and the prequel Blood Origin and showed off clips from Enola Holmes 2, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, and They Cloned Tyrone.]]></summary>

Threatening weather will force NASA to send the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket from its currently precarious position on the launchpad back to the Vehicle Assembly Building for safekeeping. The move will delay the agency’s highly anticipated launch of its Artemis I mission around the Moon. 
Due to weather predictions related to Hurricane Ian, @NASA teams will roll the #Artemis I @NASA_SLS rocket and @NASA_Orion spacecraft back to the Vehicle Assembly Building at @NASAKennedy.
First motion is targeted for 11 pm ET tonight: https://t.co/Bx7oanmpa4 pic.twitter.com/wwPds84R36

Splatsville is our runway and we’re meant to shine
 Splatoon is always all about fashion, and Splatoon 3 is no exception. Whether you’re wearing your gear for style or for stats, everyone’s Inklings and Octolings look different, as there are many options and styles to pick from.
Obviously, we had to rope together Polygon’s Splatoon 3 players to see what they were wearing. I just had to know. It’s important! (You guys should also send me pics of your Octolings and Inklings in the comments because I love seeing cool outfits. Thanks.)

Apropos of it being Monday, HBO’s dropped the first full-length trailer for its upcoming adaptation of The Last of Us, starring The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal as Joel and Game of Thrones’ Bella Ramsey as Ellie. To say that the trailer makes it seem like the show might be something of a banger would be an understatement.
Like Naughty Dog’s games, HBO’s The Last of Us from co-showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann tells the story of Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey), two people living in a world devastated by the outbreak of a deadly fungus that mutates those it infects into horrific monsters. Rather than focusing on the monsters themselves, The Last of Us’ trailer instead puts more energy into spotlighting just how much of its first season will feature Joel and Ellie keeping their wits about them as the world around them continues to go to hell. 
Based just on the handful of shots in the trailer, it’s difficult to say how The Last of Us will stack up to other zombie genre franchises built on the idea of zooming in on human drama during the apocalypse. But if the show ends up being anywhere near as unnerving and haunting as the games, HBO’s take on The Last of Us might be appointment watching when it hits HBO in 2023.]]></summary>

WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that allows users to share a direct link to a call, making it easier to stay in contact with your loved ones. The Call Links feature will start to appear on WhatsApp this week and can be accessed through a banner located at the top of the Calls tab. WhatsApp users who want to try the Call Link feature will need the latest version of the app.
Mark Zuckerberg announced the feature on Facebook, saying that WhatsApp users will be able to share a link to a call with “a single tap.” The ability to share a call link with up to 32 users was teased back in April during the announcement of another upcoming feature, WhatsApp Communities. 




The Call Links feature will support both audio and video calls, and Zuckerberg also confirmed that encrypted video calling is currently being tested for group calls with up to 32 people, which is notable, as WhatsApp currently caps video calls at eight users. 
Expanded call capacity sets up WhatsApp as a competitor for the likes of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. These rival offerings have a far greater caller capacity (100 for Google and Microsoft Teams and 300 for Zoom). However, they include restrictions like call duration for free accounts and might not be the first choice for the billions of people already chatting on WhatsApp. WhatsApp didn’t mention any restrictions on call duration, which could place it as one of the best free video calling applications for smaller teams and personal networks once the feature is widely available.]]></summary>

Joel and Ellie will arrive on HBO sometime in 2023
 HBO will soon have a new post-apocalyptic world as it premiered the first trailer for The Last of Us on Monday. The network announced the series’ premiere is coming in 2023.
The series is created by Craig Mazin, the creator and writer behind HBO’s Chernobyl. The series will be led by Game of Thrones breakout stars Pedro Pascal, who will play Joel, and Bella Ramsey, who will play Ellie. The series will also include Gabriel Luna (Terminator: Dark Fate) as Tommy and Anna Torv (Mindhunter) as Tess. The series is being developed and executive produced by Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog, the studio that developed both of The Last of Us video games. 
The Last of Us follows Joel and Ellie as they make their way through a post-apocalyptic United States that’s been ravaged by a mysterious disease that took over peoples’ brains and turned them into dangerous monsters. Along the way they meet all kinds of characters, some friendly, and others that are at least as dangerous as the infected they’re running from.

Following one of the biggest data breaches in Australian history, the government of Australia is planning to get stricter on requirements for disclosure of cyber attacks.
On Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Australian radio station 4BC that the government intended to overhaul privacy legislation so that any company suffering a data breach was required to share details with banks about customers who had potentially been affected to minimize fraud. Under current Australian privacy legislation, companies are prevented from sharing such details about their customers with third parties.

After a year off, E3, the big gaming industry convention, is set to take place from June 13th through June 16th, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and event organizer ReedPop announced on Monday. The event will be back as an in-person show at the Los Angeles Convention Center, and there will be dedicated days for industry attendees and gaming fans to hit the show floor. E3 also plans to support digital gaming events that will take place beginning June 11th.
The “E3 Business Days” will be happening from June 13th through June 15th. These days of the show will be exclusively for games industry attendees for them to network, meet up, and go hands-on with upcoming games. The “E3 Gamer Days” are set for the last two days of the show, June 15th and June 16th, where general consumers will be able to try games and “connect with developers, content creators, media personalities, and more,” according to a press release. There will be specific areas cordoned off just for industry / business attendees, which could make it easier to facilitate meetings. GamesIndustry.biz has a few more specifics on what attendees can expect if you’re interested.
E3 didn’t happen in 2022. It was originally scheduled to take place as an online-only event but was eventually canceled outright. Gaming fans weren’t without a big June gaming extravaganza, though, as Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest filled the void with both a trailer-packed digital showcase and an in-person event for media and influencers.
Summer Game Fest will be back sometime in June as well, with digital and in-person components. With both E3 and Summer Game Fest happening next year, June is shaping up to have an absolute deluge of gaming news and announcements.]]></summary>

According to local reporting, Tesla’s factory fire brigade called for the assistance of local firefighters at 3:33AM, and more than 50 firefighters were involved in helping to extinguish a large burning pile of cardboard, paper, and wood (via Electrek).
The fire occurred on the northeastern side of the property near a recycling facility. Tesla reportedly has a contracted recycling company that shreds materials there, but the cause of the fire remains unknown.

You can have it in any color you want, as long as it’s green, red, or cream. Best Buy and Walmart are currently offering the green, red, or cream colorways of the 41mm Apple Watch Series 7 for its best price ever. The GPS and cellular-equipped configuration of the Series 7 is typically priced at $499 but is available for just $329. While Apple has everyone focused on the new Series 8, the Series 7 is still every bit the excellent Apple wearable we’ve come to expect. The Series 7 offers a larger screen than its predecessor, and it can charge faster than generations that came before it.

Airlines would have to refund passengers for services they paid for that aren’t actually provided, like broken Wi-Fi, under new rules proposed by the Biden administration. Also, airlines and travel search websites would have to disclose upfront any added fees for changing or canceling your flight and for checked or carry-on baggage.
The new rules are part of a slate of changes the US Department of Transportation is proposing to make flying more transparent and consumer-friendly after a particularly rocky summer travel season, in which flight cancellations spiked. The administration has previously sought stricter rules for passenger…]]></summary>

 Editor’s note, September 26, 2022: This article has been updated to reflect recent nuclear tensions between the US and Russia.
On September 26, 1983, the planet came terrifyingly close to a nuclear holocaust.
The Soviet Union’s missile attack early warning system displayed, in large red letters, the word “LAUNCH”; a computer screen stated to the officer on duty, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, that it could say with “high reliability” that an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had been launched and was headed toward the Soviet Union. First, it was just one missile, but then …]]></summary>

Sanrio’s lazy egg is off to find their mother this December
 Gudetama the lazy egg is getting their own show on Netflix, and the streaming giant released the first trailer over the weekend as part of the Tudum fan event. Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure will premiere on the streaming service later this year, on Dec. 13.
Gudetama’s new Japanese-language Netflix series mixes real actors with CG. The trailer sees Gudetama team up with a tiny chick, Shakipiyo, on an adventure to find their mother — although Gudetama is obviously reluctant to do anything at all. 
The central conflict seems to be that Gudetama is reaching their expiration date and “going bad.” One of the human characters also vows to catch Gudetama, so it seems as if the lazy egg and Shakipiyo will spend some of their time on the run from humans.
Yuko Hara of the Southern All Stars will sing the Gudetama March theme song for the series.
For the uninitiated, Gudetama is a kawaii Japanese anime character created by Sanrio — the same company behind Hello Kitty. They’re an egg yolk with a constantly distressed face and what’s often referred to as “depression,” due to the modern world. They’re like if Winnie the Pooh’s Eeyore was a bright yellow egg instead of a stuffed donkey.
The show’s IMDB page suggests Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure’s first season will run for ten episodes.]]></summary>

Erica Lubman, an indie artist who goes by the moniker Boy Jr., is objectively good at TikTok. She has amassed more than 300,000 followers with her tongue-in-cheek songs and videos spoofing indie rock culture. Those followers have translated into ticket sales for live shows and millions of streams. But even when Lubman gets praise on videos that get half a million views — for her songwriting, for her humor — she is realistic about how fickle TikTok can be.
“I appreciate those comments a ton,” Lubman said. “But there’s a really good chance you won’t see another video from me for months because your TikTok algorithm is going to just show you other things and you’re gonna forget about me.”
On paper, it should be a golden age for music. Anyone with a song in their heart and a subscription to TuneCore can distribute their music on Spotify and other music streamers right alongside Beyoncé. And plenty are taking advantage of it — nearly 75,000 new songs are uploaded every day. So why, as research firm Luminate reported earlier this year, are consumers listening to less new music than before?


In part two of The Vergecast’s series on the future of music, I try to find out why it is so hard for new artists to break out. Speaking with industry experts, I explore the past 25 years of music streaming: from early warnings of the “celestial jukebox” to my personal golden age of music, the MySpace era, to the current boom and bust cycles of streaming today.]]></summary>

 When I reviewed the original Apple Watch SE in 2020, I was certain it was the best option for most people. In fact, my SE review was titled, “Just get the Apple Watch SE.” Back then, the always-on display was relatively new, the bigger screen with thinner bezels hadn’t arrived yet, and advanced features like EKG and blood oxygen monitoring weren’t need-to-haves for most people. (They still aren’t.) But things have changed since then. I no longer believe the SE is the best option for most people. And it’s not that the SE has gotten worse. It’s more that the SE’s role in the Apple Watch lineup has changed.

And there are likely more to come
 One of the challenges of adapting Fire & Blood is that the Game of Thrones prequel is more history book than novel, lacking much of the quirky character moments and meta fantasy jokes that are sprinkled throughout the A Song of Ice and Fire series. Thankfully, George R.R. Martin still finds ways to weave joyful surprises into the book’s detailed Targaryen history lessons.
There’s one particular tidbit from Fire & Blood that I’ve been dying to see make it to screen all season, and in House of the Dragon episode 6, it finally did. But if you weren’t already aware of this potential Easter egg and obsessively looking out for it, then you probably missed the fact that House of the Dragon just made a Muppets reference.

Customers of the consumer genetics and genealogy company Ancestry will soon be able to see which side of the family any DNA matches found through the service come from. The new feature, launching this week, builds on the SideView technology the company announced in April. 
“We’re really excited to see what users can do with this parental matches feature,” says  Caitlyn Bruns, a population geneticist at Ancestry. “I do think it will really help unlock an understanding of how you’re connected with your matches.”
The feature will let users more easily see where matches fall on their family tree. Previously, people could manually place people on one side of their family as they learned more about their matches. Now, it’ll happen automatically. 
The SideView technology leverages Ancestry’s enormous DNA database to sort which parts of a person’s genome came from each parent. When it first launched, it let users see which parts of their ethnicity came from each parent. Ancestry says SideView can have 95 percent precision for 90 percent of customers. 
Next, Ancestry plans to extend SideView to its communities feature, which connects people to groups of other users who might have descended from people who lived in the same area as their ancestors, Bruns says. It’ll group those communities by parental side. 
Once it goes live, this new DNA match feature will be available to users automatically when they log in to their account. 
“This is just something that we’re really excited about that that we can do with the size of our database and not something that other people are able to do at this point,” Bruns says.]]></summary>

Apple has started assembling the iPhone 14 in India, according to reports from TechCrunch and Bloomberg. This marks the first time Apple has shifted production from China to India this quickly after the launch of a new iPhone.
As noted by TechCrunch, Apple’s using Foxconn’s facilities in Sriperumbudur, India, to produce the device. While Apple has produced its flagship iPhones in India in the past, it’s typically done so well after the phone’s initial launch. The company only just started making the iPhone 13 in India in April, and it’s done the same with other models of the iPhone, including the iPhone 12 and 11. 
We first heard that Apple planned on closing the gap between the time it takes to switch production from China to India back in August, with Apple initially hoping to finish making the first iPhones in India in late October. A source familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Apple and Foxconn managed to smooth over supply chain issues, allowing Apple to move production to India faster.
“We’re excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. Apple didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.
Apple first started making iPhones in India in 2017 with the goal of decreasing the company’s reliance on China due to growing conflicts with the US. It also makes the devices more appealing to the Indian market, as locally producing the devices in India can make them more affordable in the country. According to TechCrunch, the standard iPhone 14 currently costs 79,900 rupees (about $980) in India, as opposed to the $799 price tag in the US.
Other companies, like Google, appear to be considering manufacturing hubs outside of China as well. Google is reportedly planning on shifting the production of its Pixel smartphone to India or Vietnam. Samsung has been making devices in the country since 2007 and opened up the world’s largest phone factory in India in 2018.]]></summary>

 Attendees at the 2022 Fantastic Fest film festival in Austin, Texas were the first to see Marvel’s hour-long black-and-white Halloween special Werewolf by Night on Sunday night, at one of the film festival’s Secret Screenings. Director Michael Giacchino — the composer for The Batman, Thor: Love and Thunder, and Pixar’s Ratatouille, Up, Coco, The Incredibles, and Inside Out, among dozens of other films — called in for a remote Q&A after the screening to explain how the project, premiering on Disney Plus on Oct. 7, came about, and why it looks and feels so radically different from any other Marvel Studios project.

The City of London police report they’ve arrested a 17-year-old in Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking and said he remains in custody. In a follow-up tweet the next day, the police confirmed the teen has been charged with two counts of breach of bail conditions and two counts of computer misuse. A hearing was scheduled for Saturday, but as of Monday morning, no further details have been released.
Police declined to say what incident the arrest was in connection with, but many of the details line up with recent high-profile hacks.

The remastered rerelease of James Cameron’s Avatar is set to earn Disney an additional $30 million in global ticket sales since last week, ranking domestically in third place at the box office behind Don’t Worry Darling and The Woman King.
The 4K HDR version of Avatar was rereleased to theaters in the US on Friday, September 23rd, after the original 2009 movie was quietly pulled from Disney Plus in order to encourage people back to the theater and build hype for its upcoming sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water.

 Intel took the desktop CPU performance crown last year with its Core i9-12900K processor. And now, nearly a year later, AMD is ready to trade blows again with its next-generation Ryzen Zen 4 CPUs. Fabbed on TSMC’s 5nm process node, AMD has promised big gains for its latest Ryzen 7000 chips over its previous Zen 3 (Ryzen 5000 series) desktop generation.
The flagship Ryzen 9 7950X chip is priced at $699 and features 16 cores, 32 threads, and a boost clock of up to 5.7GHz. We won’t be reviewing that flagship chip just yet, as AMD has only supplied the Ryzen 9 7900X in time for review, which ships with 12 cores, 24 threads, and a 5.6GHz boost for $549.

For 72 hours after it happened, Brian Chin hardly left the building. He didn’t sleep. He didn’t eat. He had arrived at 111 Chrystie, the 23-unit apartment complex his family owns in the heart of Chinatown, at a little before 6 a.m. on February 13 after getting a call from one of his tenants. It was a chaotic scene: The street in front of the building was blocked off, NYPD squad cars and officers everywhere. The police let Chin inside, but no one would tell him what was going on.

Long-distance trains in the US are very slow, but it’s much more environmentally friendly and rewarding.
 Last year, I took the Amtrak from Chicago to San Francisco in coach, and loved it so much that I did it again. So this summer, I decided to take four more long-distance trains: San Francisco to Seattle, Seattle to Chicago, Chicago to New Orleans, and New Orleans to Los Angeles. (I flew from Los Angeles home to San Francisco because of timing issues, which is a big problem with US rail — something we’ll get into later.)

A fun little AI art widget named Text-to-Pokémon lets you plug in any name or description you like and (you guessed it) generate a Pokémon matching your prompt. 
The model’s output isn’t flawless, but it’s incredibly entertaining all the same. You can try punching in the names of celebrities or politicians (see “Boris Johnson” and “Vladimir Putin” in the image above), or just general descriptions of the sort of Pokémon that would tickle your personal fancy (the one below is my “skeleton priest”).
(A little tip for using the tool more efficiently: make sure you select “4” from the “num_outputs” drop down menu to get four images per prompt rather than just one.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Night School Studio
    

  
Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals has been delayed to 2023, its developer Night School Studio has announced.  “To make Oxenfree II truly special and add more localizations, we’re moving our release window to 2023,” the developer’s statement reads. “Thank you for your patience, support, and understanding. We can’t wait to share the game with you. Stay tuned!”
This is the second major delay to have hit the sequel to the acclaimed 2016 adventure horror game. Lost Signals was originally announced in 2021 and planned for release later that year. But just a few short months later the game’s developers announced a delay to “early 2022.” No specific reason was given for the delays beyond ensuring the game is “the experience we believe it should be.”
An update on OXENFREE II: Lost Signals pic.twitter.com/bEcwrvHUR9
— Night School Studio (@nightschoolers) September 24, 2022



Night School Studio was acquired by Netflix last year as part of the streaming service’s push into mobile gaming, and just days ago an iOS and Android port of the original 2016 Oxenfree was released. The title is now available at no additional cost to Netflix subscribers, with no ads or in-app purchases. 
Set five years after the original game, Oxenfree 2 follows new protagonist Riley as she returns to her hometown to investigate some mysterious radio signals that seem eerily similar to those from the original game. The game is currently scheduled to come out on Windows, Mac, PlayStation consoles, and the Nintendo Switch. Although a mobile version doesn’t appear to have been officially announced, we’d be very surprised if it didn’t also end up on iOS and Android since mobile gaming-focused Netflix is serving as its publisher.]]></summary>

When NASA smashes a spacecraft into an asteroid on Monday, people on Earth will get an extremely close look at the action. 
NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART) is headed for its final destination, the surface of an asteroid called Dimorphos, which it will crash into at speeds of over 14,000 miles per hour. Researchers are hoping that the collision will change the asteroid’s orbit, speeding it up just a tiny bit. 
Neither Dimorphos, nor its larger companion, Didymos, pose any danger to Earth, but the experiment is designed to test whether or not a similar impact could make a difference if scientists ever discovered an asteroid that posed an imminent threat to life on Earth.

The Republican justices who overruled Roe v. Wade are only getting started.
 The headline of this piece is likely to turn a few heads. The Supreme Court’s last term, after all, was an orgy of conservative excess unlike any since the Court’s Great Depression-era attacks on the New Deal. And it culminated in the demise of Roe v. Wade, arguably the most closely watched Supreme Court decision since the justices declared school segregation unconstitutional in 1954.

Cameron Green and Tim David scored the bulk of runs as Australia put 186 for 7 after being invited to bat. Chasing the target 187, India won the match after impressive performances by Virat Kohli who scored 63 runs and Suryakumar Yadav who scored 69 runs at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad. The victory marked India's 21st T20I win in 2022 out of 28 matches. With this, Team India surpassed their arch-rivals Pakistan's record, who had previously held the record of 20 T20I wins in 2021. The victory against Australia also marked Rohit Sharma's 33rd win as India's T20I captain, putting him ahead of Kohli. The Indian team has had four captains in T20s this year with Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant leading the side. Post the win, Rohit shared a few pictures on social media and captioned it as, "CHARACTER 🇮�🇳�." India will next face South Africa in a three-match T20I series, beginning on September 28, 2022.]]></summary>

A guide to Rhaenyra, Alicent, and Daemon’s post-time jump children
 Time jumps are critical to how House of the Dragon is telling its story about a tumultuous moment in Targaryen history. None of those time jumps are as important as the 10-year leap  episode 6 takes. While much has changed in King’s Landing in the time the show skipped, one shift that has the potential to confuse audiences is the addition of so many new characters, in the form of the children of Alicent, Rhaenyra, and Daemon. 
To help you keep track of all six children that appeared this episode (including five new ones), here’s a breakdown of Rhaenyra and Alicent’s respective families:

And episode 6 was his coming-out party
 The sixth episode of House of the Dragon introduced an element to the show audiences had been expecting for a while: a big time jump. New actors have stepped in to play old roles, and a host of new characters have been introduced in the 10-year gap between episodes 5 and 6.
But the character whose role in the show increased the most in that time skip was present (and played by the same actor) before that 10-year gap: Larys Strong (portrayed by Matthew Needham). Who is he, and what’s his whole deal? We’re here to help, dear reader.

We’re now 10 years closer to all that fire and blood
 One creative decision has been looming over House of the Dragon since the August premiere of the show: A 10-year time jump right in the middle of the show’s first season, one that would mark new actors assuming the lead roles of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower. With a few exceptions — like those who play the children of Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), who are each portrayed by three sets of actors throughout the season — Rhaenyra and Alicent are the only two main cast members to swap performers after the time jump. This has made the mid-season decade leap forward feel unusually weighty — and for the most part, House of the Dragon does not make a big deal of it. 
This is in keeping with es…]]></summary>

Microsoft Surface tablets have been taking a beating at football events these past two weekends. During the Buffalo Bills game against the Miami Dolphins this afternoon, Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey took his frustration out on his tablet as the Dolphins secured a win during the final moments of the game.
Dorsey’s reaction may have been warranted, although he probably could’ve chosen another outlet for his anger (like a stress ball perhaps?). The Bills had a chance to run one more play to win the game, but the team ultimately ran out of time, losing to the Dolphins 19-21. When cameras turned to the booth where he was watching the game, Dorsey ripped off his headset and tossed his hat before he picked up the tablet and started violently slamming it against his desk. 
What an ending to the Bills-Dolphins game! #BUFvsMIA pic.twitter.com/yjlc3H0wUi
— NFL (@NFL) September 25, 2022



Last weekend, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady spiked a Surface tablet into the ground after his team made an incomplete pass when they faced off against the Saints. This temper tantrum even caught the eye of Microsoft Surface chief Panos Panay, who responded by saying “Rest assured the Surface should be just fine.”
Microsoft partnered with the NFL back in 2014 to replace the paper-based system of reviewing plays on the sidelines with Surface tablets. Since then, the tablets have seen abuse from Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Patriots coach Bill Belichick, and, of course, Tom Brady, who’s been caught tossing the tablet twice so far.]]></summary>

Dimorphos is a lump of space rock so far away from Earth that we don’t even know what it looks like — and on Monday, we’re going to smash it with a spacecraft. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will be traveling at more than 14,000 miles per hour when it hits the asteroid, in what has to be one of the most metal science experiments of all time. 
DART is a NASA effort to see if it can change an asteroid’s movement in space. It’s being billed as the world’s first “planetary defense test mission” —  a test run to see if we have what it takes to avert a serious asteroid impact on Earth sometime in the future. You know, just in case.

DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket hasn’t had a very good start to the football season. For the past two weekends in a row, subscribers have struggled to get their streams to work, and this weekend is no exception.
Even before today’s games started, users began complaining about numerous issues, with many saying that they can’t log into their accounts on the Sunday Ticket website or app and others having problems loading the streams. Those who are able to access the stream are reporting quality issues.
Somehow Sunday Ticket is acting worse than last week. Truly depressing. @DIRECTV
— Alex Reno (@alex_reno) September 25, 2022



DirecTV hasn’t issued any statement about whether it’s working to fix the stream, and the company didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. In a response to one user’s issue on Twitter, DirecTV said “we know some customers can’t access NFL Sunday Ticket online or through the app” and that its “teams are working to resolve this.” Aside from DirecTV, users trying to stream football through CBS on Paramount Plus are also reporting problems.
In what will probably come as a relief to football fans, DirecTV’s rights to NFL Sunday Ticket expire at the end of this football season. This leaves room for another company to snap up the rights to Sunday Ticket, with Apple, Amazon, Disney, and Google reportedly looking to air Sunday Ticket on each of their respective streaming services. 
So far, Amazon Prime Video’s showing of Thursday Night Football has shown some promise. The streamer’s first-ever live football game performed a heck of a ton better than DirecTV for the past few weeks, even with some minor blips here and there.]]></summary>

Apple could introduce a new naming scheme when it releases the iPhone 15 next year, replacing the current “Pro Max” branding with “Ultra.” This is according to Apple tracker Mark Gurman, who also expects the iPhone 15 to come with some “bigger changes,” including USB-C.
The Pro Max name first appeared with the iPhone 11 in 2019, and adding Ultra branding to the iPhone lineup wouldn’t be all that surprising. Apple already launched the new Watch Ultra with the moniker earlier this month, and added the name to its M1 Ultra processor. Apple also introduced a minor change to its naming scheme with the iPhone 14, bringing back the seemingly retired “Plus” name to the iPhone 14 Plus.

Shooting action over 50? No problem for these stars
 In the crowded field of Netflix original programming vying for viewer attention, it’s difficult to stand out and be noticed. There has to be something that causes the endless scrolling to stop for a moment, for the potential viewer to linger on a title in hopes that it will intrigue enough to warrant a press of the play button — a hook.
The latest original film from the streaming giant, Lou, about a desperate mother’s attempt to rescue her kidnapped child from the wilderness with the aid of a mysterious hardened tracker, certainly has an intriguing hook. The grizzled hero with a mysterious past aiding the mother is portrayed by the unconventional choice of Allison Janney (I, Tonya). People might s…]]></summary>

Apple Pay Later is facing some “significant” setbacks that could delay its launch until next year, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The feature is Apple’s version of a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, letting you make a payment through Apple Pay and then pay it back in four installments without interest.
Apple said its Pay Later feature would arrive with iOS 16 when it first announced the program at WWDC in June.

 Spending a grip on a gaming laptop isn’t difficult; a cursory search on gaming laptops will net you several options that cost more than $4,000. But finding a laptop that’s giving you the greatest return on your investment is more of a challenge. If you’re spending around $3,000 on a gaming laptop like the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, you want it to bury the competition, not just scrape by. Unfortunately, the Triton 500 SE is a bit disappointing and doesn’t flex its hardware enough to set it apart in a crowded market. 
Housed in its all-silver chassis, the $2,999.99 configuration of the Triton 500 SE we tested includes a 12th Gen Core i9-12900H processor, RTX 3080 Ti graphics card, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of…]]></summary>

James Earl Jones has been the iconic voice of Darth Vader since the beginning of Star Wars, but at 91 years old, it seems he’s ready to have the work done for him. According to a report from Vanity Fair (via Deadline), Jones signed over the rights to his archival voice work, allowing the Ukrainian startup Respeecher to leverage AI technology and recreate the sound of his voice in Disney Plus’ Obi-Wan Kenobi.
To do this, Respeecher uses sound bites to “clone” an actor’s voice, allowing a studio to record new lines without having the actor present. Matthew Wood, Skywalker Sound’s supervising sound editor, told Vanity Fair that he presented Jones with the option once he “mentioned he was looking into winding down” the role of Da…]]></summary>

Italy’s potential far-right turn is years in the making.
 Giorgia Meloni, the founder of the hard-right party Brothers of Italy, could soon become Italy’s first woman leader and the first far-right leader in decades, since the fall of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini during World War II.
Italy will hold snap general elections on Sunday to elect a new parliament, and Meloni’s party is widely considered the favorite to come out on top as the leading partner in a new conservative coalition, with Meloni as prime minister.

Big names like The Witcher, Knives Out, Enola Holmes, and Bridgerton all made appearances on the livestream
 For a second year in a row, Netflix held a livestreamed event called Tudum to show off some of its biggest upcoming movies, TV shows, and now games. (Though the names are the same, this Tudum has nothing to do with the struggling fansite also managed by Netflix.) There were a few notable absences from the 2022 edition — I’m still waiting to hear or see something about season 2 of Arcane — but there were also plenty of big names. That includes news about two different Witcher shows, trailers for Enola Holmes and Knives Out, and the surprise launch of an excellent indie game.

In Netflix’s upcoming sci-fi comedy feature The Cloned Tyrone from director Juel Taylor, everybody with even the slightest bit of common sense knows that Black people have plenty of reasons not to trust the government or the police stalking their neighborhoods. Some of those reasons, like police brutality and harassment, are obvious. But the real threat everyone’s facing in They Cloned Tyrone’s first trailer is a bit more hidden and insidious because it’s the sort of thing few people would be inclined to believe.
They Cloned Tyrone tells the story of Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris), Slick (Jamie Foxx), and Fontaine (John Boyega), three unlikely friends who are brought together by their shared discovery of a massive, secret governmental surveillance plan to monitor the lives of Black people before disappearing them and replacing them with clones. It’s hard to tell from They Cloned Tyrone’s trailer just what the end goal of snatching folks up is, or how three conspiracy theorists are supposed to take down that sort of operation on their own. But it does seem like They Cloned Tyrone’s going to have one hell of a good time reminding people what the concept of staying woke actually means when it hits Netflix on December 30th.]]></summary>

The brief clip showed off the mixture of humor and mystery that you’d expect from another Knives Out.
Glass Onion is an important movie for Netflix, and not just because it’s a centerpiece of the company’s holiday schedule. The company reportedly paid more than $400 million for two sequels to Rian Johnson’s original whodunit, and Glass Onion also features a star-studded cast including the likes of Janelle Monáe, Leslie Odom Jr., David Bautista, Jessica Henwick, Kathryn Hahn, Kate Hudson, and Edward Norton, alongside star Daniel Craig.
Knives Out is just one of several cinematic universes that Netflix is hoping to turn into its next big film franchise.
Glass Onion starts streaming on Netflix on December 23rd, and will be in select theaters before that. In the meantime, you can check out our spoiler-free review.]]></summary>

Fear not, Witcher fans: The prequel series Blood Origin arrives Christmas Day
 Netflix’s 2022 Tudum event gave fans updates on two upcoming projects in the Witcher universe. The third season of The Witcher, starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, will arrive in summer 2023. The limited series prequel spinoff The Witcher: Blood Origin, starring the incomparable Michelle Yeoh, will arrive on Netflix Christmas Day.
The poster for the third season of The Witcher shows a broken version of Geralt’s wolf medallion, and also features a small bird in the same style as the medallion.

In the poster for Blood Origin, we see a pair of arms holding weapons, forming an X. Both arms are tattooed with images of animals — the one holding an ax appears to have a wolf tattoo, while the arm with a shorter blade has a bird tattoo.
Season 2 of The Witcher opened with arguably the best episode the show’s ever had, and the long gap between seasons changed some plans and set up both season 3 and Blood Origin. We’ll have to wait a bit longer to see if season 3 can live up to that, but at least we’ll have Blood Origin in the meantime.]]></summary>

Yet another beloved indie game is now available on Netflix. At its Tudum event today, Netflix announced that the supernatural thriller Oxenfree, which first launched in 2016, is now playable through its fledgling games service. The Netflix version of Oxenfree is available as a free download to Netflix subscribers on both iOS and Android, and features subtitle support for more than 30 languages.
Netflix has steadily been adding excellent games like Into the Breach, Before Your Eyes, and Lucky Luna to its mobile gaming offerings, but Oxenfree is particularly notable because Netflix acquired its developer, Night School Studio, last year. Oxenfree also feels like a good fit for Netflix, with its focus on storytelling and a vibe that’ll appeal to Stranger Things fans. A sequel is also in the works.


Elsewhere, Netflix announced two games that will be launching on September 27th: Spongebob: Get Cooking and Desta: The Memories Between, which is developed by Monument Valley studio Ustwo. Other games listed as “coming soon” include a mobile version of the acclaimed Kentucky Route Zero and a baking game based on the Netflix series Nailed It.
Netflix started its foray into gaming late last year, though early reports suggest that it hasn’t caught on with the majority of subscribers yet.]]></summary>

When Netflix announced during last year’s Tudum that a third season of The Witcher was already on the way, there was some hope that maybe, just maybe Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia would be back on our screens slaying demons in time for the upcoming holiday season. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case, and there’s going to be a bit of a wait, but not an especially long one.
While there was no new footage from The Witcher’s third season shown at this year’s Tudum presentation, Cavill and co-stars Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan a made brief appearances to share some teaser art and to announce that the series will return in 2023. 
Taken at face value, there isn’t all that much to glean from the teaser art, which features the wolf, swallow, and obsidian star symbols associated with Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefir in Netflix’s adaptation of The Witcher. But the way Geralt’s wolf medallion — a powerful magic tool — is broken in the art could be a nod to how Geralt’s original medallion is destroyed in The Tower of the Swallow, the fourth novel in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher Saga. 
Netflix’s series, CD Projekt Red’s video games, and Sapkowski’s novels are all very different beasts. But it wouldn’t at all be surprising to see a rather major moment from the source material becoming one of The WItcher’s big season 3 plot points when it returns some time next summer.]]></summary>

While the third season of Netflix’s live-action Witcher series still doesn’t have an actual premiere date, the wait for Declan de Barra and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich’s upcoming The Witcher: Blood Origin prequel series is almost over.
Netflix’s The Witcher: Blood Origin hits Netflix on December 25th. And while we didn’t get a new trailer for the series — which tells the story of the very first witcher, long before Geralt’s iconic adventures — we did learn that Minnie Driver will be joining the cast, where she’ll star alongside the likes of Michelle Yeoh.
While you wait, you can check out the very first teaser for the series right here — and a brand new poster below.

Once upon a time, it seemed as if Netflix’s upcoming stop-motion Pinocchio from co-directors Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson’s might in a bit of competition with Disney’s “live-action” spin on the classic story from Robert Zeemckis. But that all changed when del Toro stopped by Netflix’s annual Tudum event to give everyone a closer look into the labor-intensive, mesmerizing, and magical process that brought his Pinocchio to life.
In the new video, which features a number of different Pinocchio scenes in the midst of production, del Toro opens up a bit about what all he wanted to bring to his take on the fairytale, and why he insisted that the bulk of its animation was done by hand. 
While there’s also quite a bit of digital production involved in the film’s making, del Toro explained how the minute imperfections that come with hand-made stop motion art have a way of making stories like this feel more magical because they give you a sense of how the overall process works.
“I really wanted this movie to land in a way that had the expressiveness and the material nature of a handmade piece of animation — an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,” del Toro explains. “But it had the sophistication of movement that research in rigs and puppetry-making have taken us.”
 Pinocchio is set to hit Netflix on December 9th.]]></summary>

The unlikely hit premieres in November
 Manifest is back from the dead with the first trailer for its fourth and final season, this time with Netflix. The series is bringing back creator Jeff Rake for the new season, as well as its stars including Melissa Roxburgh, Josh Dallos, Athena Karkanis, and J.R. Ramirez. 
The first look at Manifest season 4 debuted during Netflix’s Tudum event on Saturday. The show’s final season will include 20 episodes, with the first batch arriving on Nov. 4. 
Manifest follows the passengers aboard an international flight that hits severe turbulence and has to be diverted. Though the plane lands safely, the passengers learn that they’re been gone for more than five years. Along with trying to piece their lives back together, the survivors also starts to experience strange voices and visions.
The series originally aired on NBC, but was canceled in 2021 after its third season. Manifest then made its way onto Netflix, where it quickly became the platform’s most watched series, reaching a whole new audience. This surge in popularity caused Netflix itself to pick up the rights to the series and greenlight this final season.]]></summary>

This new teaser is only 41 seconds long, but it’s filled with so much. For one, two fan favorite characters make their first appearances: Ravkan prince Nikolai Lanstov, as played by The OA’s Patrick Gibson, appears in the first moments of the teaser talking to Alina; later on in the clip, Jack Wolfe appears as Wylan — the sixth member of the Six of Crows, though canonically in the timeline he hasn’t really met the others yet. Also appearing are ruthless mercenaries Tamar and Tolya, played by Anna Leong Brophy (Traces) and Lewis Tan (Mortal Kombat) respectively. 
Of course, we also see Jessie Mei Li as Alina Starkov, powerful Sun Summoner, and Ben Barnes as the ruthless, yet captivating Darkling — along with the shadowy Six of Crows characters and everyone else from the first season. 
The second season of Shadow and Bone is expected to follow the events of the second book in the main trilogy, Storm and Siege. But like the first season of the show, the new batch of episodes will also incorporate characters not seen until later books in order to flesh out the storylines.]]></summary>

It’s tough being Sherlock Holmes’ little sister 
 Enola Holmes is back — and this time, she has a detective agency of her own. Netflix released the first trailer for the sequel, due out this November, at the company’s Tudum fan event.
As it turns out, trying to establish yourself as a private investigator is particularly tough when you are (1) a girl, (2) a teenager, and (3) the younger sister of the esteemed Sherlock Holmes. But Enola’s luck changes when a young factory girl brings her a case — the girl’s sister has been missing for a week and it’s up to Enola to solve the case. 
Enola Holmes 2 finds Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown reprising her role as the charming Enola. Henry Cavill once again plays a particularly hunky iteration of Sherlock Holmes, with Helena Bonham Carter as the Holmes’ siblings eccentric mother (in the first movie, The Hunger Games’ Sam Claflin played stuffy eldest brother Mycroft, but it’s not clear if he’s returning for this one). Additionally, Louis Partridge returns as Viscount Tewkesbury, the missing young lord from the first movie who strikes up a friendship with Enola.

Iran is in revolt.
 It was not an isolated incident of police violence in Iran. But the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last week has captured the country’s attention. 
Amini was visiting the capital of Tehran, coming from the Kurdish province in the country’s northwest, and Iran’s so-called morality police detained her, allegedly for wearing the mandatory headscarf improperly. Several hours after entering police custody, she was in a coma. She died two days later. Iranian police claimed she died after a stroke and suffering cardiac arrest, but witnesses say she died after sustain…]]></summary>

How a WWE wrestler, corrupt Mississippi officials, and Brett Favre allegedly siphoned money away from poor people.
 We live in an age of brazen, ham-handed grift. Have you heard the one involving the retired NFL star, a WWE wrestler, corrupt Southern officials, and the millions in welfare money that they benefited from? 
If you’ve heard about this scandal, it’s likely because of the involvement of former Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, specifically the $1 million in federal welfare money he received for talks he apparently did not give and the $5 million he was involved in directing toward construction of a volleyball stadium at the college his daught…]]></summary>

One of the best movies of the year is one of many leaving streaming this month
 Fall is finally upon us, and with it comes a whole season of movies to choose from. Before we can get to those, though, we have to pick out the very best of what’s streaming in September before they float away like so many leaves. 
We’ve got a fantastic crop of films to choose from in the form of David Prior’s 2020 breakout horror film The Empty Man, Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2, and Michael Bay’s action heist thriller Ambulance, not to mention classics like Alain Resnais’ avant-garde masterpiece Last Year at Marienbad, 1999’s The Mummy, and more.
Without further ado, here are 19 of the best movies to watch before they leave streaming in September.

His legal problems are worsening. But they might not take him down.
 Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: New developments have put Donald Trump in even more serious legal jeopardy.
A new civil fraud lawsuit from the New York attorney general’s office is threatening his business, while his efforts to stall the criminal investigation into whether he mishandled classified information seem to have failed. And a separate investigation into the January 6 attack scrutinizes his associates.
It all looks quite bad for him. Then again, for at least five years, much of the media has touted the seriousness of Trump’s legal peril, portraying…]]></summary>

 Giorgia Meloni and her far-right Fratelli d’Italia are expected to lead a far right victory in Italian elections this weekend. That win, if it happens, would come shortly after the far-right Sweden Democrats won the second-largest share of the vote, helping to oust the center-left from power and giving the far right a potential role in the next government.

The record-breaking anime feature finally comes to streaming this week
 This weekend sees the premiere of Athena, the explosive French thriller epic from acclaimed music video director Romain Gavras on Netflix, as well as the highly anticipated streaming premiere of the record-breaking Jujutsu Kaisen 0 anime film on Crunchyroll. If neither of those strike your fancy, not to worry — this week is practically bursting at the seams with exciting new movies to stream and rent on VOD.
We’ve got the action thriller Lou starring Allison Janney (The West Wing) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country) and the Tyler Perry-directed period romance drama A Jazzman’s Blues on Netflix, the time-hopping romance comedy Meet Cute on Peacock, the Oprah Winfrey-produced Sidney Poitier…]]></summary>

Sony’s PC outreach continues with another PlayStation exclusive
 Step aside Peter Parker. It’s Miles Morales’ turn for a Windows PC port. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is coming to Windows PC and it got its first teaser trailer on Friday.  There’s no specific release date yet, but it’s scheduled to launch this fall. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is currently available on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The port will give Windows users the change to experience the glittering adventure for themselves. The teaser trailer shows Miles Morales in his sleek and shiny spider-suit, slinging webs and stomping bad guys to protect New York City.
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales features a lot of similar gameplay and locales as Insomniac Games’ 2018 hit Marvel’s Spider-Man. But it still delivers an original story starring Miles Morales in the hero’s role. In this 2020 adaptation, Peter Parker is out of town, so it’s up to Morales to keep the peace in New York. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not have a launch date, but players can wishlist it on Steam and the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

Sauron? Or just Some-guy-ron?

In the show’s third episode, we got another character to toss into the pile of Sauron Potentials. And then, in the fifth episode, that theory was uttered out loud.

No Church in the Wild director Romain Gavras brings the righteous fire
 Athena, the latest film from music video director Romain Gavras, is a one-trick pony, but that trick is so formally dazzling that the movie is an enrapturing experience. Composed of several lengthy, labyrinthine takes spaced out by traditionally edited scenes, it follows three French-Algerian brothers in Paris — young and middle-aged adults from different walks of life — thrown into disarray in the immediate aftermath of a harrowing family tragedy.
Their youngest sibling, a child named Idir, has been murdered, and the culprits caught on camera appear to be French police. The oldest brother, Moktar (Ouassini Embarek), is a drug and weapons trafficker who only looks out for…]]></summary>

Amazon’s show adds a new legend to Tolkien’s legendarium
 Despite its status as a prequel, Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power still has plenty to teach us about the history of Middle-earth, or at least its version of that history. While the show’s latest episode covers many different bases, perhaps its most interesting has to do with the history of mithril, a legendary elf, and the Misty Mountains themselves. 
[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power episode 5, “Partings.”]

He’ll be joining his grandson Morty 
 Rick Sanchez, the eccentric genius from the popular Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, will be the next playable character to join the roster of MultiVersus. We don’t have a release date yet, but publisher Warner Bros. Games says he will come to the game “soon.”
You can catch a glimpse of Rick in a teaser trailer that was released Friday. The match starts off with a fight between Wonder Woman and Reindog. Suddenly, their battle is interrupted by the appearance of a green portal, with blue humanoid alien creatures called Mr. Meeseeks emerging from it. The trailer ends with Rick exiting the portal and letting out a giant belch.
Rick will be a “mage / ranged” character, according to his description on the game’s website. He is following his grandson Morty, who was added to MultiVersus in August as part of the season 1.01 patch.
MultiVersus is a free-to-play fighting game featuring a roster of fighters from various Warner Bros. properties. When he arrives, Rick Sanchez will join characters like Batman and Superman on the fighting stage. If you want to see who else you can play as, we have a full list of all current and upcoming characters.]]></summary>

 Kicking off a new tabletop role-playing game with a small group of friends is hard. There’s getting six people’s schedules to line up bit, of course, which is always a chore. But learning a new game system requires study, and rolling up four or five new characters takes time. Game developer One More Multiverse wants to help, and it’s producing a set of tabletop tools to make playing with your friends online a lot easier. The venture capital-backed team is going at things very differently than its competitors. Whether you’re a potential newbie player or a long-suffering Dungeon Master, you should at least consider giving the demo a try.

Circumstances match other arrests linked to major breaches
 London police have arrested a teenager on suspicion of hacking offenses, authorities said on Friday. The 17-year-old suspect was arrested in Oxfordshire, England as part of an ongoing investigation with the government’s National Cyber Crime Unit. Police declined to confirm any other details regarding the arrest and investigation — just that the suspect is in custody.
That said, the circumstances follow earlier arrests connected to a hacker group that is said to be responsible for breaches at Uber and Rockstar Games, the latter of which led to leaked footage of the in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 published over the weekend.

 Y’all know what a palantír is, right?
For those neither versed in the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien nor the films of Peter Jackson, it’s one of those creepy, indestructible crystal balls scattered across the world of Middle-earth that allows the Eye of Sauron to warp the minds of any hapless fool of a Took (*cough* Pippin *cough*) unfortunate enough to steal a glance into its murky depths.
Playing Hyper Demon, the latest first-person shooter by Devil Daggers developer Sorath, is kind of like staring into one of those — but instead of mind-melting horrors, it has rocket jumps and a leaderboard.

The series hasn’t missed a beat in its transition to half-hour television
 If you, like me, were terminally online around the early 2010s, you probably know, love, and have sorely missed Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared. 
Co-created by animators Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling, the six-episode web series set a fire across the Internet when it was released on YouTube between 2011 and 2015, with a unique blend of puppet-based antics and Lynchian shock humor. The animated shorts have since amassed over 216 million collective views on YouTube and inspired everything from elaborate fan theories involving Serbian war criminals to a small clothing line. Now, over six years since the last short, Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared has finally returned as a half-hour television seri…]]></summary>

New information from Splatoon 3 casts doubt on his record
 Splatoon 3 imagines an alternate world where ocean creatures, instead of mammals, took over the land. The game is set in a post-postapocalyptic world where humanity has been wiped out and sentient ocean life has taken its place. The signature character of the series, an Inkling, can take on both the form of a kid and a squid. There are a few exceptions to the game’s theme, however, including Li’l Judd, a cat who helps referee your matches. But now, a shadow of speculation has been cast on the adorable fuzzball due to new information revealed in Splatoon 3.

Dead Reckoning and 3,000 Scoundrels use clear cards to build replayable games
 Many board game publishers make a tidy profit on upgraded components — things like metal coins and card sleeves that make their products more appealing at the table. But some companies are building entire games around these kinds of bits. Just look at the poker-style chips and custom dice that Chip Theory Games uses, or the neoprene game board at the center of Leder Games’ Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile. This year, yet another rare and expensive component has had its breakout moment: clear plastic playing cards.
These unusual transparent sheets feel just like regular playing cards. You can shuffle them and you can sleeve them, so they seamlessly integrate into deck…]]></summary>

An epic drought in the West is drying up the river. But that’s only part of the story.

The river’s flow is down by about 20 percent, compared to the 1900s, and the two largest reservoirs it feeds are less than a third full. The water in Lake Mead, the nation’s biggest reservoir, has dropped more than 150 feet in the last two decades, leaving little water for the more than 40 million people who depend on the river.

House Democrats used a recent vote to show voters they are for the police. 
 On Thursday, House Democrats passed a package of bills intended to blunt the GOP broadsides they’ve faced on crime, seeking to dispel any perceptions that they want to “defund the police” amid growing worries about public safety. 
Democrats tried to strike a delicate balance with this package: While it includes more grant money for police, it also contains bills that would invest in reform efforts activists favor such as community-based violence interventions and first responders who are trained specifically to address mental…]]></summary>

Maw and Disorder puts Sylvanas on the stand
 Hearthstone is due for another mini-set, and while Blizzard has just left the Shadowlands behind for the next World of Warcraft expansion, the trading card game’s current expansion is Murder at Castle Nathria, a mystery murder set in the vampiric domain of Revendreth. A murder is usually followed by a trial, and that is the case here — the next mini-set is Maw and Disorder, and it’s themed around the trial of Sylvanas Windrunner.
Sylvanas was the main antagonist of World of Warcraft for some time, starting in the Battle for Azeroth expansion and concluding in Shadowlands. It looks like Hearthstone intends to take a significantly sillier take on her appearance; for instance, Sylvanas’ new Legendary card is revealed with a cheesy spinning newspaper reveal.
When she hits the stand, everyone will know. ‍⚖️
Introducing, Sylvanas! pic.twitter.com/oodXoGRNUP
— Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) September 22, 2022



It doesn’t look like this is the same trial that Sylvanas faced in World of Warcraft either, where she stood in front of Tyrande Whisperwind and her former colleagues to admit fault for all of her war crimes. This time, it looks like Sylvanas is facing off against the Jailer, the end boss of Shadowlands, in court.
The mini-set will reveal of 35 new cards: four legendary, one epic, 14 rare, and 16 common cards. Players can either find these cards in Murder at Castle Nathria packs or as a Mini-Set bundle.]]></summary>
