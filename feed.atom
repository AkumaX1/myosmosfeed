The long-anticipated launch of NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket has been pushed back to mid-November after NASA waved off its September 27th launch plans in the wake of Hurricane Ian (via Space.com). The space agency announced on Friday that it’s aiming to squeeze in the Artemis I launch between November 12th and November 27th.
While there was initially a slight chance that NASA’s next launch attempt could take place in October, that was ultimately scrapped after NASA decided to roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to shield it from the storm. NASA successfully secured the rocket on Tuesday after an hours-long trek to the VAB.
Hurricane Ian made landfall in Florida as a Category 4 hurricane, but weakened into a tropical storm by the time it reached the Kennedy Space Center on Thursday. NASA says “there was no damage to Artemis flight hardware,” and that its facilities only suffered “minor water intrusion.”
NASA’s Artemis I launch will send an uncrewed Orion capsule on a journey around the Moon, paving the way for future missions that will bring the first woman and person of color to the lunar surface. The agency’s first launch attempt was cut short after the rocket experienced engine issues, while its second was marred by a “large” leak that occurred when engineers filled up the rocket with chilled liquid hydrogen fuel.
Subsequent testing of the rocket’s fueling system showed that the leak was still present, but at a more “manageable” level. Now that the rocket’s back at the VAB, NASA says it will “prepare for additional inspections” and retest the Flight Termination System, which the Space Force uses to destroy the rocket if it goes off course.]]></summary>

Dish and its Sling TV streaming service have dropped Disney’s package of channels after the companies couldn’t come to a contract agreement (via Deadline).

As if the launch of the Pixel Watch hasn’t been spoiled by enough leaks already, a new set of images shared with Slashleaks by reliable leaker OnLeaks (via 9to5Google), show the smartwatch in even more detail just days ahead of Google’s launch event. This expands on what we’ve already seen in a brief ad from Google released last week, revealing an array of band styles, more watch faces, as well as some other features the watch could come with.
For starters, the Pixel Watch could offer silicone band styles in black, eggshell, dark gray, and silver, as well as three braided options in orange, green, and black. It also looks like Google’s planning to offer two different leather band styles, includ…]]></summary>

Players are as fast as ever — when they have to be — as motion capture gets more lifelike
 Pace is pretty much everything in FIFA 23. In fact, it was the first thing I noticed, even in — maybe especially in — my first match.
Though FIFA 23’s HyperMotion 2 system of motion capture and machine-learning is by definition an iterative work, complete with a buzzy marketing term applied to it, it’s not an incremental one. By capturing, analyzing, and processing more 11-on-11, 90-minute real-world soccer matches, EA Sports is selling FIFA 23 as a game where players have, if not greater control over the ball, then at least a greater understanding of how their on-screen footballer can manage it.

As the sun sets over the mountain ranges that overlook the city, the slow duet of erhu and harp music enlivens the landscape.

There’s the smell of sizzling sausage, car exhaust, and late-season playoff hopes in the air on Tuesday night as I cross the street toward the stadium. I’m carrying a neon green Mariners fanny pack across my chest (that’s how the kids are wearing them, right?!?) loaded with the essentials: my ID, Kleenex, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, and an iPhone 14 Pro. The roof of T-Mobile Park hangs open over the adjacent railway, looming like the Death Star, and I head toward an entrance with a few things on my agenda, in no particular order:

Here’s what you should be playing on Xbox and PC
 Xbox’s Game Pass service is having another strong year. From new titles like Nobody Saves the World to legacy juggernauts like Halo: The Master Chief Collection, it’s still the easiest way to keep up with gaming without breaking the bank. And the service is always evolving, adding new games each month, with many of the titles available across multiple Xbox consoles and PC through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.
Microsoft’s Bethesda acquisition saw great titles like Skyrim and Fallout 3 come to Game Pass. And many expect similar moves to come for games like Overwatch 2, Diablo 3, and maybe even World of Warcraft, with Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard still churning in the background.

The wired version of the Eufy Dual video doorbell is on sale at Amazon or direct from Eufy for $149.99 ($50 off).

Tesla's Optimus robot prototype was not the only thing the company shared on Friday evening during its AI Day presentation. Autopilot director Ashok Elluswamy took the stage during Tesla's AI day to talk about how the company's Full Self Driving software has improved. He revealed that there are now 160,000 customers running the beta software, compared to 2,000 from this time last year. 
In total, Tesla says there have been 35 software releases of FSD. In a Q&A at the end of the presentation, Musk made another prediction — he's made a few before — that the technology would be ready for a worldwide rollout by the end of this year but acknowledged the regulatory and testing hurdles that remained before that happens.

While he reportedly didn’t address any specific rumors, a recent report from The Hollywood Reporter seems to be the likely target of his comments.

Twitch will begin testing a way for its users to boost their chat messages on the platform. Called “Elevated Chat,” the “experiment” is meant to let users elevate their chat messages for a specific time using a one-time fee. The fees are presented in five different tiers ranging from 30 seconds to two and a half minutes, with fees ranging from $5 to $100. 
The feature is currently available for a “limited number of channels” on the platform. The option to elevate chats may appear at either the top of the chat or at the bottom of a video, and a user can purchase an Elevated Chat depending on how long they want to keep their message up.
According to Game Developer, multiple people can elevate their chat message at once, but it is on a first-come, first-served basis, is queued depending on who purchased it first, and “is managed by streamers and moderators.” Once a chat message is up, moderators can “timeout” or ban the user. If a comment is removed, users won’t be able to receive a refund, and they won’t be able to elevate someone else’s chat message, either. 
As far as revenue, the experiment will feature a 70 / 30 split for creators. The Twitch test began on eligible channels on Thursday and is set to run for about four weeks. It will be available in the US, and other supported countries include Germany, Canada, Australia, Korea, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, South Africa, and Taiwan.]]></summary>

How and when you can play Blizzard’s free-to-play sequel
 Overwatch 2 is almost here, but exactly what that means is still awfully confusing. The game has an official release date of Oct. 4, but it’s full of so many changes from the previous game that players might still have a whole lot of questions about what the game is, when it’s out, or even how much it costs.

When does Overwatch 2 come out?

 Stadia users weren’t the only people shocked to learn that Google would be shutting down the cloud gaming service; developers making games for the platform were surprised, too.
“I woke up getting ready for my workday, and I see on our Discord private chat for the company that one of my employees sent a message saying ‘is this true?,’ with a link,” Rebecca Ann Heineman, CEO of Olde Skuul, said in an interview with The Verge. “I follow the link and it’s like ‘oh, okay.’” Olde Skuul had planned to launch Luxor Evolved on Stadia Pro on November 1…]]></summary>

Plus, a peek at Overwatch’s new souvenirs
 Overwatch 2’s transition from a premium game (the original Overwatch) to a free-to-play one will bring a long list of in-game purchases, including a seasonal battle pass, as well as à la carte skins and other cosmetic items. Blizzard plans to introduce a new battle pass about every nine weeks, with skins, sprays, animations, and bundles of digital goods rotating through the store on a faster cadence.
The season 1 paid battle pass includes a variety of legendary- and epic-tier skins, as well as the first mythic skin, a customizable look for Genji called Cyber Ninja. The pass also includes a variety of sprays, voice lines, player icons, emotes, and two new cosmetic types: weapon charms and souvenirs.

Google’s timing and strategy were wrong, but the tech is here to stay 
 An understandable knee-jerk response to Google shuttering its Stadia game-streaming service is: That must be it for cloud gaming, right? We have proven that nobody wants it. Now go away with your laggy, fuzzy, insubstantial server-side gaming. The market says no.
This is not the first time this has happened. Cloud gaming service OnLive tried to steal a march on a nascent technology in 2010 — disastrously too early, it turned out. The service was closed in 2015 after Sony bought it to, essentially, strip it for parts. Stadia, which was launched by one of the world’s richest companies, boasted cutting-edge engineering, and was located at the physical heart o…]]></summary>

The most recent Dev Channel update prevents users from uninstalling Win32 apps, which means many of the games found on the Microsoft Store and Steam will be stuck on your computer for the time being.
Microsoft’s Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25211 was recently released to subscribers of the Windows updates Dev Channel.

Along with a new suite of Halloween-themed skins
 Halloween is on the way, and Respawn will be hosting its own celebration for the year’s scariest season in Apex Legends. The Fight or Fright event will run from Oct. 4 through Nov. 1, and offer limited-time modes and seasonal skins.
The event kicks off on with Shadow Royale, a trio-queue mode in which eliminated characters respawn as speedy shadows that can double jump, revive their allies, and deliver extra melee damage. It’s a chaotic twist on the usual formula, and this year it’ll take place on the Olympus After Dark map.
On Oct. 11, the Gun Run mode returns on Olympus After Dark, Fragment East from World’s Edge, and Skull Town from King’s Canyon. Gun Run is a four-team match, where players have to get kills with their current weapon in order to upgrade to higher levels and more efficient gear. Add in infinite ammo, health, and automatic respawns, and it’s a fast-paced test of your mastery of the game’s weapons.
Gun Run will be replaced on Oct. 18 with the Control limited time mode, which has teams competing to see who can maintain control over key buildings on the Olympus After Dark, World’s Edge, and Storm Point maps. 
The event wraps up on Nov. 1, with one final week of Shadow Royale. Throught Fight or Fright’s run, players will be able to unlock Halloween-themed skins in the Store tab, including a Bladed Wanderer skin for Seer, or an Inner Demon skin for Ash.]]></summary>

Earlier this year, Bandai America announced that the TinyTan Tamagotchi, a new handheld game featuring the members of BTS, was on its way. The $19.99 gadget is up for preorder now, and it ships on October 3rd. As a fan of all things BTS and K-pop who also happens to review things for a living, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to test it out. 
The conceit of a Tamagotchi is innocuous enough. It’s a teensy egg-shaped device with a screen in the middle and three buttons across the bottom. Traditionally, that screen is occupied by a virtual pet — you feed this pet, play games with it, and such by pressing various combinations of said buttons. The TinyTan Tamagotchi is like that, except the pet under y…]]></summary>

Maybe the Lord of the Rings villain is hiding in plain sight
 All right, let’s play: The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’s Sauron might really be Halbrand (Charlie Vickers) and it might sorta be a missed opportunity if he isn’t. The thought occurred to the Polygon crew during his first scene — wouldn’t it just be interesting if the sole human to survive alongside Galadriel, who pulled her from the Sundering Seas, was Sauron, the big bad she’s been hunting for years and the scourge of (future) Middle-earth? 
Though it’s not a theory that consumes us, or even necessarily one that we’ve put much stock into, it has continued to color every scene with him in it. There’s still the outstanding character no one knows much about who looks nefarious in the tra…]]></summary>

Don Cheadle was set to star in the Disney Plus show, but now it’s a film
 Marvel Studios’ previously announced Disney Plus series Armor Wars has officially grown too big for its metallic britches: Marvel confirmed Thursday that the project has been upgraded to a “theatrical release,” or what the viewers might call a movie. Armor Wars Mark II currently does not have a release date on Disney and Marvel’s extremely packed theatrical calendar. 
Armor Wars stars Don Cheadle as James “Rhodey” Rhodes, aka War Machine, and adapts a Marvel Comics plotline that finds Tony Stark’s armor tech falling into various wrong hands. The switch from series to feature is a win for Cheadle, who has diligently played a supporting role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe across various…]]></summary>

With plenty of terror and tension for the Halloween season
 There are a lot of different ways for games to scare players. Some use resource scarcity, forcing you to agonize over every bullet. Some assault you with grotesque monsters that make your skin crawl at the mere sight of them. There are games that obscure your senses so you can’t see or hear what’s around the next corner, and games that give you no way to fight back at all. And then there’s the old-fashioned jump scare — ever reliable — like zombie dogs unexpectedly crashing through a window.
GTFO does all the above. But the co-op horror shooter takes things even further: It uses difficulty to inject each moment with terror, and blow past every game in the genre. Many players who try GTFO will call it p…]]></summary>

Meta announced on Thursday that it’s giving everyone in the US the ability to share “digital collectibles” (read: NFTs under a new name that social media execs think is more appealing) on Facebook and Instagram. Sharing on the latter platform is also available in over 100 other countries. The feature, which was limited to select users at first, works by having you connect your crypto wallet to your profile, after which you can create a post featuring the NFTs in that wallet. According to a blog post from Meta, sharing a digital collectible results in “automatically tagging the creator and collector.”

Teenage Engineering is known for its playfully designed audio synthesizers you can digitally make music with, but now it’s made a way you can save your tunes in the most analog way possible: on records. The Swedish company’s new PO-80 Record Factory is a turntable that lets you cut your own lo-fi vinyl records and play them back as well.
The PO-80 only supports 5-inch records for cutting and supports four minutes or three minutes of recording time per side at 33 rpm and 45 rpm, respectively. You can also attach an included 7-inch record adapter to play back larger records, though you can’t cut them.

Google is shutting down Stadia, its polarizing cloud gaming service, only four weeks after the company’s target audience of me, Makena Kelly, actually started using it. 
When Stadia was announced in 2019, Google pitched it as the future of gaming, providing a more accessible alternative to expensive PC rigs or whatever $500 next-gen console iteration was on the horizon. And when Stadia finally launched, it worked. Sure, features were missing, and connections were shaky, but suddenly I had access to a handful of games that would have previously cost me hundreds of dollars in hardware and controllers to play — a steep investment I wasn’t willing to make for games I may have only thrown on for a few hours.
Despite Stadia’s obvious benefits, it took me until just a few w…]]></summary>

Anker announced its latest wave of wireless earbuds yesterday, and the products indicate that Anker is expanding its focus beyond the usual sound quality upgrades. The company announced three pairs in all: the Soundcore Liberty 4, Soundcore Sleep A10, and Soundcore VR P10 earbuds.
The new Liberty 4 earbuds do offer better sound; they’re Anker’s first “stick”-style buds to include dual drivers in each earbud. But they can also read your heart rate for fitness and wellness purposes. This functionality has been rumored for Apple’s AirPods lineup but has yet to materialize.

This week, the world watched what’s likely to be the fossil fuel industry’s single largest methane release ever. An astonishing amount of methane is floating up from the now-notorious Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines and rising above the surface of the Baltic Sea. It’s a pollution nightmare. It also pales in comparison to the vast amount of methane that oil and gas operations constantly release. 
Up to 778 million standard cubic meters of methane gas could spew from the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines in a worst-case scenario, according to the Danish Energy …]]></summary>

Stadia may be shutting down next year, but if you’ve purchased Ubisoft titles on the cloud gaming platform, you’ll be able to transfer those purchases to PC at some point in the future, Ubisoft confirmed to The Verge.
“While Stadia will shut down on January 18th, 2023, we’re happy to share that we’re currently working to bring the games you own on Stadia to PC through Ubisoft Connect,” Ubisoft senior corporate communications manager Jessica Roache said in a statement. “We’ll have more to share regarding specific details as well as the impact for Ubisoft+ subscribers at a later date.”
This means that players who may have invested in Ubisoft’s games on Stadia will be able to play them again on their PC down the line. That said, some people may have bought a game on Stadia because they could play without a souped-up PC, so you may have to upgrade your PC hardware to play it once you transfer it over. It’s unclear at this time if you’ll be able to bring over your saves and progress. 
Google has already shut down commerce on the Stadia Store, so you won’t be able to buy an Ubisoft game now so you can redeem it on PC later. However, Google is going to refund all software purchased on the Stadia Store, so if you previously bought Ubisoft games on Stadia, you’ll be getting your money back.
Ubisoft will continue to invest in cloud gaming, despite Stadia’s discontinuation. “We believe in the power of streaming and cloud gaming and will continue to push the boundaries on bringing amazing experiences to our players, wherever they are,” Roache said.]]></summary>

Out Oct. 25, Cabinet of Curiosities collects some superstar horror directors 
 Guillermo del Toro’s highly anticipated horror anthology series finally has a release date.  Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities is coming out on Oct. 25, just in time for Halloween. Additionally, Netflix released a new trailer teasing more of the collection to fans on Friday. 
The anthology will bring together a superstar team of horror directors who have worked on films like The Babadook, Splice, and Mandy. Each chapter of the eight-episode series tells its own story with a different cast and director. In Friday’s trailer, the stories appear to draw imagery from all sorts of horror films. The new look shows everything from goblinlike monsters to creepy woods. 
Some of the directors involved are Jennifer Kent (The Babadook), David Prior (The Empty Man), Catherine Hardwicke (Twilight), and Ana Lily Amirpour (A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night). The series will feature actors such as Essie Davis (The Babadook), Andrew Lincoln (The Walking Dead), F. Murray Abraham (Mythic Quest), Tim Blake Nelson (Watchmen), Crispin Glover (American Gods), Peter Weller (RoboCop), and Rupert Grint (Harry Potter).]]></summary>

Director Andrew Dominik’s experimental Marilyn Monroe biopic gets downright weird and borderline offensive in its discussion of abortion
 Netflix’s Blonde from director Andrew Dominik transforms Ana de Armas into Marilyn Monroe (visually, at least) with a stunning level of detail that’ll make you wonder whether any post-production VFX was involved. Outside of its optic uncanniness, there’s nothing about de Armas’ performance itself as Marilyn that raises that question. But it’s somewhat hard not to consider after Blonde introduces one of its strangest characters: a judgmental CGI fetus who sometimes talks to Marilyn Monroe from within her uterus to shame her for having had …]]></summary>

Defense Matrix will transcribe ‘temporary’ voice chats of reported players
 Overwatch 2 will collect temporary voice chats of reported players in an effort to cut down on disruptive behavior once Blizzard’s free-to-play shooter launches on Oct. 4.
As detailed in a recent Blizzard blog post, the system will use a speech-to-text tool to transcribe a voice recording, and will delete the clip once the transcription is complete. Blizzard’s “chat review tools” will then examine the transcript to deem whether a reported players has engaged in disruptive behavior. The text file will itself be erased no later than 30 days after the transcription takes place.

Google Stadia is shuffling off this mortal coil on January 18th, but thankfully, Google is offering refunds for anyone that purchased Stadia hardware or games from the Stadia store. Google has made an official statement with details regarding the Stadia platform and when users can expect refunds, but here’s a synopsis of what we know so far.


Stadia will remain operational until January 18th, and you’ll continue to have access to your games until then, giving you the opportunity to transfer progress and tie up other loose ends. However, Google has disabled the Stadia storefront, so you won’t have the ability to make any additional purchases.

Flying to heights The Cape could never reach 
 Seven years after its final season aired, Community is finally getting the movie it’s always aimed for. The project was announced on the show’s Twitter account, with star Joel McHale and NBC’s Peacock accounts confirming it was all real. The Community movie will stream on Peacock when it’s released. 
Community was created by Dan Harmon and started airing on NBC in 2009. Harmon was fired from the show after its third season, which gave season 4 a very different feel, and even led to the characters breaking the fourth wall and calling it “the gas leak year.” (Harmon was later re-hired for season 5 of Community.)
The series reached cult-favorite status among its die-hard fans, but rarely, if ever, was it a ratings smash, which made its renewal an open question each year. Community’s writers and cast even justified the show’s renewal with a joke made in season 2, episode 21, when Abed Nadir declared that “six seasons and a movie” was the perfect lifespan for a TV show. (The punchline became a meme and social media hashtag.) Community eventually made it to six seasons, but only after it was canceled on NBC and revived on Yahoo!’s short-lived streaming service, Yahoo! Screen.
One open question about this reunion movie is who, from the original cast, might actually return for it. According to Peacock’s announcement, Joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacos, Jim Rash, and Ken Jeong are all set to return, with Dan Harmon back to write. For now, Donald Glover and Yvette Nicole Brown are not confirmed to return; it’s also unclear if Chevy Chase will come back, though he left the show before season 5, reportedly due to frequent on-set arguments with other actors and crew.]]></summary>

It took me joining a baking club to realize just how good my KitchenAid stand mixer’s controls are. Ever since I got it a few years back, I’ve admired the simplicity of its two-lever system: one that lets you tilt the head up and down and one to control the speed. But now that I’m using it every week, I’ve finally figured out what makes it click so well for me: it’s the fact that the speed lever feels sturdy and rugged while also providing incredibly precise control.
The speed control lever’s job is made fairly obvious by its name: it lets you control how fast your mixer is mixin’ and also acts as an off switch at its “0” setting. The lever is a sturdy metal affair, and the v…]]></summary>

After making improbable returns for its fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons, Community will deliver on a long-running joke / promise with a movie, but this time, it’s on NBC’s streaming service, Peacock. Community debuted in 2009, and when NBC canceled the show in 2014, fans began a social media campaign for #SixSeasonsandaMovie based on a line from the show, which they’re now going to get.
And a movie?
— Peacock (@peacock) September 30, 2022






Series creator Dan Harmon is on board, along with much of the original case, including Joel McHale, Danny Pudi, Alison Brie, Gillian Jacobs, Jim Rash, and Ken Jeong. In recent months, Harmon had been saying the movie was a matter of “when and not if,” and now it’s clear why he was so confident. Original cast members who departed the show before it ended, like Yvette Nicole Brown, Chevy Chase, and Donald Glover, were not mentioned in the press release announcing the movie.
Peacock didn’t even exist during any part of the show’s run since it launched in 2020 but is somehow delivering on the show’s fateful prediction that, at the time it was said, seemed destined for fulfillment by Netflix since that was practically the only subscription streaming service going. 
Since the show was canceled, there has also been Harmon’s 2018 admission of harassment and abuse of a writer on the show’s staff.
Sony Pictures TV and Universal Television are working together on the new season, which doesn’t have a release date yet, and mentioned that Peacock has (non-exclusively) acquired rights to stream the full series library. It may arrive soon, however, as the press release included the picture above, which is apparently from episode nine of season 6, titled “Grifting.”
Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.]]></summary>

If the deal on the 512GB M2-powered MacBook Air we featured earlier this week was too spendy for you, fret not, because Apple’s base model is currently even cheaper. Right now, Amazon and Best Buy are selling the model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for just $1,049 ($150 off), the laptop’s lowest price to date. Unlike Amazon, however, Best Buy is discounting all colors in case you’re not a fan of dark blue or gray.
True, it may take a while to perform some tasks given the storage on the base model is slower than that of the new 512GB M2-powered Air, but it’s still faster overall and should satisfy the average person’s needs. Plus, it significantly improves upon one of th…]]></summary>

Arrival, an electric vehicle startup based in the UK, announced that its so-called “microfactory” based in southern England has produced its first production verification vehicle. The news comes as the company is reportedly in talks to raise money so it can build and sell its electric vehicles in the US. 
The electric van was produced using “in-house technologies, including composite materials, autonomous mobile robots, in-house components and a software defined factory,” the company said. The milestone is proof that Arrival’s microfactory concept, which are highly automated small-footprint facilities where it plans to build its vehicles, is working.

Let’s face it: many of us don’t pay enough attention to what streaming services we are subscribed to — and paying for. Especially now, when there are more and more services vying for our attention, it’s easy to go for a trial subscription, or to decide that you’re going to subscribe “just for a couple of months,” and then completely forget about it. Meanwhile, your charge card is being pinged every month.
For example, over a year ago, Matthew Inman, the comics artist who creates the site The Oatmeal, reported (to his apparent chagrin) that he had been paying for Netflix’s DVD subscription for the last 13 years:
Today Netflix was kind enough to let me know that  I've accidentally been paying for a DVD subscription for THIRTEEN FUCKING YEARS.…]]></summary>

The first trailer teases the blockbuster action coming to America in December
 For most American viewers, Netflix’s Korean import series Squid Game was probably an introduction to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the hapless series protagonist, and one of the more tragic victims of its lethal children’s games. But Lee has been a high-profile star (and sought-after fashion model) in Korea for decades, and with the new action-driven spy thriller Hunt, he makes the leap to film director as well. 
Lee co-stars in Hunt as the head of foreign operations for Korea’s Central Intelligence Agency, opposite Jung Woo-sung as the head of domestic operations. When a series of crucial intelligence leaks threatens South Korea’s president, the two agencies learn that there’s a high-powered, deep-cover mole somewhere within the KCIA. Both men investigate, but as their effort heats up, it also turns into a profoundly personal feud, as they both try to uncover and expose each other as possible North Korean spies.
The film, which premiered at the 2022 Cannes International Film Festival, is a sprawling but intense action film that balances spy-agency intrigue with shootouts and mass combat. As the dueling leaders weaponize their entire agencies against each other, sending hordes of agents into shootouts and chases in their attempts to be the first to reach any new information or useful asset. It’s blockbuster-level filmmaking, and the first trailer for the film shows off some of Lee’s directorial skills in terms of staging street warfare and mass faceoffs.
Hunt will premiere in theaters and on VOD on Dec. 2.]]></summary>

The NSA, as a rule, wants to employ people who are good at spying. But according to the FBI, one former employee tried to turn the tables on the agency and was caught in the act.
Per details released by the Department of Justice this week, a Colorado resident was arrested Wednesday and charged with attempting to transmit classified information to a representative of a foreign government.
The press release says that Jareh Sebastian Dalke, 30, was employed by the NSA from June 6th to July 1st, 2022. Between August and September 2022, feds say that he used an encrypted email account to transmit portions of three classified documents to an individual who he believed to be working for a foreign government. 
In fact, that individual was an FBI agent who lured Dalke into a stin…]]></summary>

Andrew Dominik settles for sensational, shocking turns with his Marilyn Monroe biopic 
 Prior to its release this week, the controversy surrounding Netflix’s Marilyn Monroe film Blonde centered on its NC-17 rating. According to reports, the film was delayed by a year as Netflix wrangled with director Andrew Dominik over the final cut, apparently hoping to avoid the rating. Rumors swirled about the extreme sexual content that might have earned it.
The true mystery, however, was why the streamer would care. An NC-17 rating greatly limits theatrical distribution and marketing, making it a commercial disaster for a traditional studio. But this should not trouble Netflix, which typically gives its prestige films like Blonde a very limited theatrical run in order to qual…]]></summary>

Thursday morning, I woke up in a haze and decided to listen to ambient music while I drank my first cup of coffee. The night before, I’d saved an album to Spotify, but when I fumbled through the panels of the desktop app, I couldn’t find it. The menu was full of recommendations and recent plays — I couldn’t find “Albums” anywhere in the list. There wasn’t even a clear way to navigate to it. I tried cycling between the Home and Your Library tabs, but nothing turned up an Albums button. The side panel showed playlists, and the album I wanted wasn’t in my recent listens. I could search for it if I remembered the album’s name, but I didn’t. 
Eventually, I got there by tinkering with the window size and keeping an eye on the top menu bar, but I had spent whole …]]></summary>

Guillermo del Toro is finally ready to show off the first proper trailer for his intriguing Netflix anthology called Cabinet of Curiosities. The series is made up of eight stories with names like “Graveyard Rats” and “Dreams in the Witch House,” and the first trailer definitely makes it seem like — while they’re all spooky — we’ll get a nice mix of genres and styles: haunted houses, gothic horror, and straight-up slasher stories.
That likely comes down to the variety of creative minds working on the show. While del Toro penned two original stories for Cabinet of Curiosities, the anthology also includes episodes from The Babadook director Jennifer Kent, Cube director Vincenzo Natali, and Mandy director Panos Cosmatos, among others. The series similarly has a wonderfully eclectic cast, including the likes of Rupert Grint (the Harry Potter films), Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Ismael Cruz Córdova (The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power), Elpidia Carrillo (Predator), and Charlyne Yi (Paper Heart).
Cabinet of Curiosities starts streaming on Netflix on October 25th, and it comes alongside several other promising Halloween movies and shows this year, including Netflix’s adaptation of the Stephen King short Mr. Harrigan’s Phone (October 5th), Mike Flanagan’s latest series The Midnight Club (October 7th), and Hulu’s reboot of Hellraiser (October 7th). There’s also more from del Toro coming later in the year with his stop-motion adaptation of Pinocchio, which is coming to Netflix on December 9th.]]></summary>

Less than a year later, it was just another Google experiment that did not catch fire.
Thursday’s announcement wasn’t shocking for the fact Google was pulling the plug on its vegetative streaming games platform; it was remarkable because Google was offering refunds to anyone who spent money (other than the monthly subscription fee) on the service.

Stadia will shut down on January 18th, 2023. Here, you’ll find the latest developments on the service as its winds down as well as pieces from our writers on its impact (or lack of it) on the gaming and tech industry. 
 Google announced on September 29th, 2022, that its Stadia cloud game streaming service will be terminated in late January 2023. You can no longer make purchases through the platform, and notably, Google is offering refunds to gamers for everything that they might have purchased during its three-year existence: controllers, games, and all.
Despite coming to a close (which many predicted given Google’s tendency to kill projects instead of letting them fizzle out), Google arguably succeeded at delivering on its promise of bringing cloud game streaming to a bunch of screens before Microsoft, Sony, and Amazon had formal plans to do the same. It was also novel in the industry for being a platform that didn’t require any hardware buy-in on the side of the user; you could plug a controller you already owned into your computer and get started by launching Google Chrome. Here’s our original review from 2019, for old times’ sake.
We’re taking a look back and a look forward to dig more into Stadia while we still can. You’ll find all posts about the death of Stadia — and possibly the remnants of it that will live on — rounded up in this StoryStream.]]></summary>

Rising sea levels and increasing storm intensity will put more and more hospitals in danger of flooding, just like the ones facing Hurricane Ian this week, a new study found. 
Ian sent water pouring into HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital in Port Charlotte, Florida, this week. The hurricane churned through the coastal town just north of Fort Myers on Wednesday, flooding the building’s lower levels just as winds ripped the roof off — letting the pounding rain in from above. Doctors in the hospital were expecting issues, internal medicine specialist Birgit Bodine told The Associated Press.
“We didn’t anticipate that the roof would blow off on the fourth floor,” she said.

Tesla’s AI Day kicks off today, September 30th, at which Elon Musk has said he hopes to show off a working prototype of the company’s humanoid robot, Optimus. The event, which will be held at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, will be livestreamed for the public and is estimated to start at 5PM PT / 8PM ET — assuming the event begins around the same time as last year’s AI Day. 
The company hasn’t yet shared details on tuning into the AI event, but it’ll likely be streamed on its YouTube account like the first Tesla AI Day. We don’t have a lot of details about what will be announced, but based on the invitation, we’re likely to hear about the “latest developments in artificial intelligenc…]]></summary>

The best controllers for your Nintendo Switch aren’t the ones that come with each system. The removable Joy-Cons included with all Switch consoles (except for the Switch Lite) are convenient since they can be detached to use as wireless controllers for two people. But their tiny, contourless design isn’t that comfortable for long gaming sessions or large hands. And don’t get me started on the dreaded Joy-Con drift.
Thankfully, you have plenty of alternatives, though only some of them are worth your money. In this buying guide, I focus on wireless controllers that are comfortable and reliable and a few with unique features that enhance your play time,…]]></summary>

J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth rules run into trouble in episode 6
 “Udûn” is The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’s first full-fledged battle episode, and fans of the Prime Video series certainly get their money’s worth in terms of sheer blockbuster spectacle. Yet for all the toppled towers and climactic cavalry charges, the episode’s most memorable scene is also one of its least bombastic: the quiet conversation between Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) and Adar (Joseph Mawle). More than anything else that happens in “Udûn,” this largely action-free encounter dramatically alters the status quo of The Rings of Power going forward — although whether it does so for the better or the worse is tough to call.

The 2022 midterms are coming up on November 8, when voters across the US will decide the makeup of Congress, determine who will hold key offices in their states and cities, and weigh in on policies directly via ballot measures. 
Democrats currently have narrow majorities in both chambers, and because the same party holds the White House, conditions are ideal for them to pass bills President Joe Biden will sign. But forecasts suggest Democrats are likely to lose control of the House and keep the Senate this fall — though many key races are so close that anything is possible. 
Beyond Washington, governors, secretaries of state, and attorneys general, along with members of the legislature, are up for election in dozens of states. The winners of those contests will affect state policies on issues as varied as abortion, voting rights, and Covid-19.
Vox has been digging into the stakes of individual races and the entire country and will continue to through and even after Election Day. If you’re just starting to follow the elections, you can get a better understanding of what’s on the line here, and if you’re trying to figure out what you need to do to vote, start here. 
Do you have something you want explained that you don’t see on this page? Ask a Vox reporter your questions about Congress here, about what’s going on in the states here, and about the politics of the midterms here.]]></summary>

The SuperSpeed USB branding is no more thanks to a new set of guidelines currently being rolled out by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), the body that manages and maintains the USB standard. 
It’s part of a rebranding initiative that the organization kicked off last year with the introduction of a new series of packaging, port, and cable logos. But with its latest set of branding and logo guidelines it’s going even further, simplifying its legacy branding and signaling the end of the decade-old SuperSpeed branding. If the name doesn’t ring any bells, then that’s probably because you (like most other people) simply referred to it by its USB 3 version number. Alongside it, the USB-IF is a…]]></summary>

Bros wants to be a gay love story that doesn’t play it straight. 
 Billy Eichner seems like the fun kind of grumpy — like a person who will say the mean stuff you’d wish you could say out loud. Eichner rocketed to success and visibility based on his ability to charmingly harangue New Yorkers on sidewalks. Then on Difficult People, he sharpened that crankiness and pop culture savvy into an acidic, narcissistic lead also named Billy, in a show that’s loosely based on his and his friend Julie Klausner’s lives.
The underlying irony of Eichner’s humor is that the crankiness is blazing insecurity, the meanness is neurosis, and his self-absorption is a symptom of being his own big…]]></summary>

It will be streamed globally on Genshin Impact’s YouTube
 Hoyoverse is continuing its symphony concert series with “Melodies of an Endless Journey,” a performance celebrating Genshin Impact’s two year anniversary. You can watch the concert’s global broadcast on Genshin Impact’s YouTube channel on Oct. 2 at 12:00 (UTC+8). The 75-minute performance will feature renditions and live adaptations of the game’s most iconic tracks.
Storied music producer and composer Shirō Sagisu (whose work includes soundtracks for Neon Genesis Evangelion and Bleach) will serve as the concert’s music director. He will be working in partnership with the Hollywood Chamber Orchestra and various folk musicians. Eímear Noone (whose credits include World of Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo III) will serve as conductor.
“The original Genshin Impact soundtracks fit perfectly into the actual in-game scenes and ambiance, and also provide much to imagine beyond the game,” said Sagisu. “Together with the HOYO-MiX team and global artists, we’ve tried different touches to the music, weaving elements of pop music, rock, and jazz into it. Hopefully, we can create a refreshing and fun experience for the players.”
Genshin Impact is a massive, free-to-play RPG with four unique regions: Mondstat, Liyue, Inazuma, and Sumeru. Each of these has its own culture, and the game’s numerous soundtracks reflect this. Hoyoverse’s thirteenth album — which will focus on the music of Sumeru’s rainforest region — is on the horizon.
“In the past year, as Inazuma and Sumeru unfolded, we’ve strived to enrich the Genshin Impact music with inspirations drawn from all over the world,” Yu-Peng Chen, composer and music producer for HOYO-MiX said, in a release. “I’m excited to see how these soundtracks resonate with musicians and players across the world.”]]></summary>

That’s much slower than a human, for whom record times stand at 9.58 seconds for men (set by Usain Bolt) and 10.49 seconds for women (set by Florence Griffith-Joyner). However, it’s still extremely impressive for a robot of Cassie’s design. 
“This may be the first bipedal robot to learn to run, but it won’t be the last,” said OSU robotics professor Jonathan Hurst in a press statement. “I think progress is going to accelerate from here.”

Zendure’s SuperBase V is the largest and most powerful portable battery yet. Not only can the 6.4kWh battery-on-wheels be expanded to 64kWh via stackable modules, it stores electrons in what the company calls the “first home energy system with semi-solid state batteries.” It can accept up to 3,000W of solar input, can be charged at a level 2 EV station, and includes external running lights, voice control, and powered wheels (because of course it does).
According to Zendure, semi-solid state batteries offer 42 percent higher energy density and improved safety compared to lithium-ion phosphate (aka, LFP or LiFePO4) batteries — the current gold standard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bollywood's starry couple Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal's wedding festivities have officially begun and we can't stay calm. The couple has adorably shared similar posts as a sneak peek at their pre-wedding ceremonies in Delhi. The bride-to-be captioned the post as, "#RiAli Mohabbat Mubarak," to which her beau wrote, "RiAli. Tumko bhi..." In the pictures, the couple is glowing and twinning with their ensembles. Richa looks absolutely breathtaking in an embroidered pink lehenga and Ali Fazal complimented her in a white angrakha. Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal will get married on October 4. Earlier, a picture of the couple's wedding invite went viral. The wedding invite features a kitschy rendition of both Richa Chadha and Ali Fazal riding bicycles. The invite is designed in the shape of a matchbox and the text printed on it reads "Couple Matches." The duo's friend Puneet Gupta has designed the invite. Puneet Gupta, Richa and Ali's friend who designed the card said, "The Save the date is about celebrating being an 80's kid and taking inspiration from Vintage Indian poster art. It is also kind of interesting to do a very different and quirky take on the couple along with a retro twist and a touch of Bollywood." There are likely to be three pre-wedding functions - Cocktail, Sangeet, and Mehendi. All three functions, as revealed by our source, are likely to be held in New Delhi. Although the outfit Richa is going to be wearing for her wedding isn't known to us yet, the jewellery has been picked from Bikaner. For the Delhi functions, the actress' jewellery is being custom-made by a 175 old jeweller family from Bikaner. The Khajanchi family are a revered family of jewellers who are known for their statement heirloom pieces and they will be designing signature pieces for Richa. Richa and Ali first met on the sets of 'Fukrey' in 2012 and soon fell in love. (All photos: Instagram)]]></summary>

I’ve had a love-hate relationship with Google Stadia, but I’m certainly going to miss it now it’s shutting down. While the writing has been on the wall for Stadia pretty much since it launched, I was one of the many (or the few as the joke goes) to be intrigued by this cloud-powered future of gaming. I paid the entry fee for a (mostly) empty stadium, but I enjoyed it anyway.
It hasn’t been easy to like Stadia. The first few months of the service felt like a beta I was paying Google to test. I couldn’t initially connect the Stadia controller wirelessly to a PC or phone; the browser streaming wasn’t as high quality as the Chromecast output; and Google Assistant integration was useless.
Google had also promised neat YouTube integration and the ability to share game clip…]]></summary>

Carrie Jenkins on what philosophy can teach us about love and heartbreak.
 




Do we need a new vision of romantic love? 
When you think of romantic love in popular culture, you probably think of one of two things: limitless joy or unspeakable sorrow.
Pick your favorite stereotype: obsessed teenagers who can’t leave each other’s side until some youthful misdeed leads to a cry-fest. Or maybe it’s the romance novel depictions of infatuated adults tangled up in passionate love triangles. 
The point is, even if we know real relationships are much more complicated than this, we’re still drawn to misleading models of romantic love.
A new book by the philosopher Carrie Jenkins, called Sad Love: Romance and the Search for Meaning, wants to scrap the…]]></summary>

One of the iPhone 14 Pro’s big new features is a big new camera sensor. For the first time, an iPhone has a high-resolution main camera sensor — 48-megapixels to be exact — and the best thing about it isn’t that you can take 48-megapixel photos. You can, sure, but RIP your phone’s storage space. Nope, one of this sensor’s best features is the 12 megapixels in the middle. Apple has added a 2x zoom mode to its camera app, and all it does is use the central portion of the main camera sensor to crop in and mimic the effect of a 48mm-equivalent telephoto lens. That’s it. Simple, but it’s actually kind of a big deal.

Come January, Google will be shutting down its Stadia cloud gaming service. In some ways, the move isn’t much of a surprise — as my colleagues have pointed out, there’s been doubt about whether Google was in it for the long haul with Stadia basically ever since it was announced in March 2019.
If you’ve been listening to what the company said about the service, though, you’d be forgiven for being blindsided. Up until the very end, Google insisted there’s a wonderful future for Stadia, and that players should keep signing up for and using the service, despite rumors that it was about to go bust. Now that Stadia’s officially being shut down, let’s take a look at the times Google promised us…]]></summary>

How to make sure you know what they want so you can honor their wishes without having to guess.
 Confronting the fact that our loved ones will someday die — that we all will — is one of the hardest parts of being human. Most of us don’t like to think about death, and as long as it doesn’t feel urgent, it’s easy to avoid discussing it with family and friends. 
Avoiding the reality, though, is risky. It increases the likelihood that we’ll be unprepared to make medical decisions when we need to make them. If we’re forced to make choices for an incapacitated loved one and don’t know what they want, we might agonize over whether or not we’ve made the right choice.
Over the last few years, I’ve been talking to my parents about death, in part because of my dad’…]]></summary>

Texas voters will get to render a verdict before the courts do.
 On Monday, the top legal authority in the state of Texas reportedly fled his own home rather than allow an official to serve him a subpoena. 
According to an account from the man who served the subpoena, reported in the Texas Tribune, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton appeared to try and wait out a process server with the subpoena for an hour in his home, then later ran away as the server approached him, and finally rode away in a truck driven by his wife as the server laid the documents on the ground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Prime Video
    

  
Yes, really, that’s Mount Doom
 Middle-earth has plenty of famous mountains, from the peaks of the Misty Mountains to Erebor, but perhaps the most important to the story is Mount Doom, the volcano at the center of Sauron’s evil domain of Mordor. In the latest episode of Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, we got a surprising and explosive origin story for the series’ most famous volcano.
[Ed. note: The story contains spoilers for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power episode 6.]
To answer the most obvious question first, yes, that was in fact Mount Doom that erupted at the end of the episode. In case you, like Galadriel, are terrible at remembering what Middle-earth looks like on a map, the Southlands of The Rings of Power, where the besieged village of Ostirith sits, also happens to be the land that will later become Mordor. 
It seems that the evolution of the land from lush fields and beautiful mountains was part of a grand design by either Morgoth or Sauron and was triggered by the sword-key, releasing a massive flood. This flood destroyed the land, thanks to the tunnels the orcs had already dug, and triggered an eruption of the volcanic Mount Doom (though in the show’s time it doesn’t have that name yet) until it erupted. This eruption spewed molten rock and magma in a miles-wide radius that it appears will remain scorched forever, or at least until Frodo, Sam, and Gollum arrive there with the One Ring.
While the history of Mount Doom isn’t very explicit in Tolkien’s lore, the show’s story does seem to mostly line up. We know that the land wasn’t always called Mordor, and that the name likely arrived after Mount Doom’s eruption, but there’s no mention of the eruption itself being caused by an intentional flood.
As for what will happen to the area next, and how long it will take before Sauron takes up residence there, we’ll just have to wait to see where The Rings of Power takes its story next.]]></summary>

Today Anker is adding a new entry to its line of Soundcore earbuds with the Liberty 4. While this set keeps the brand in the budget earbud category with a $149.99 price, they’re the first ones in this line to combine a “stick” design (as seen in the Liberty Air 2 Pro) and dual dynamic drivers that Soundcore claims “push the boundaries of sound performance, offering clarity across all frequencies for the best listening experience with all genres of music.”
The Liberty Air 2 Pro made our list of the best cheap earbuds last year, and the Liberty 3 Pro managed to impress for the price when we reviewed them in February, despite ANC that could use some improvement and some extra emphasis on bass and treble under their default settings.

Smart home company Eufy’s new wireless security camera, the EufyCam 3, bumps up the resolution to 4K and adds a built-in solar panel to extend the year-long battery life even further. But its best features come from the new HomeBase 3 hub the camera connects to wirelessly. This adds local processing of video to send you an alert when it spots a person, pet, or vehicle, plus facial recognition so it can tell you if it’s a stranger or a family member. 
Another interesting feature is the option to upgrade the storage to as much as 16 TB of local storage with a hard drive slot. Eufy says this is enough for 60 years of motion-activated video footage, and it adds the capability to record continuous video — a first for the Eufy ecosystem.

SpaceX and NASA have agreed to figure out whether or not a SpaceX ship could visit and potentially breathe new life into the iconic Hubble Space Telescope. They announced that they were partnering on a study that would look into whether or not that kind of mission was even possible.
The study will take about six months to complete and will involve NASA and SpaceX. It also involves the Polaris Program, a private human spaceflight effort funded by billionaire Jason Isaacman. Earlier this year, Isaacman bought three flights to space on SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft, a series of missions he’s calling Polaris.

Climate change is helping cyclones intensify faster, produce greater storm surges, and dump more rain — all of which makes hurricanes more destructive and expensive. One early assessment for Ian indicates it cost as much as $40 billion in property damage. 
Engineers have long defended against the threat of hurricanes by building structures like levees and seawalls. Yet these tools are imperfect. They can damage the environment, they don’t always hold the water back, and th…]]></summary>

Intel surprised PC gamers earlier this week with $329 pricing for its top Arc A770 GPU, matching Nvidia’s RTX 3060 retail pricing. While it’s still difficult to find an RTX 3060 at $329, Intel is now undercutting Nvidia’s popular GPU with a $289 starting price for its A750, a card it claims should be able to trade blows with the RTX 3060.
We’re still waiting on independent reviews of the Arc A750, but Intel did release 48 benchmarks last month showing that it should be able to beat or come close to Nvidia’s RTX 3060 performance in modern games. Intel tested its A750 directly against the RTX 3060 across 42 DirectX 12 titles and six Vulkan games, and the results look promising.
Intel is clearly aiming for performance per dollar and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: 20th Century Studios
    

  
Sorry humans, you had your time
 The recent Planet of the Apes trilogy is one of the most consistently fun and thoughtful blockbuster franchise revivals in recent memory. Beginning in an understated fashion with Rupert Wyatt’s 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the series took off when The Batman director Matt Reeves grabbed the baton for 2014’s Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes with an understated approach to post-apocalyptic action that never lost sight of the humanity in its story about a burgeoning ape society. 
Turns out their story is not over: Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, “an all-new chapter in the ‘Planet of the Apes’ saga” will enter production next month. According to 20th Century Studios, the story will pick up many years after the conclusion of War for the Planet of the Apes, but any plot details beyond that aren’t being revealed yet.
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will star Owen Teague (It), Freya Allan (The Witcher), and Peter Macon (The Orville), and it will be directed by Wes Bell (known for the Maze Runner films but also the unfortunately canned animated adaptation of Mouse Guard). While this seems like a changing of the guard, two of the writers on the script — Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver — worked on the first two films, and they’re joined by Josh Friedman and Patrick Aison (the latter of which wrote the excellent Prey). 
Unfortunately, there’s no mention of the one thing that helped make the new Apes trilogy such a success: Weta Digital’s work bringing the Apes to life, which included an all-time great performance from Andy Serkis as the ape leader Caesar. That’s not to say the movie can’t be good with another team and performer, it’s just easily the biggest shoes to fill, the sort of thing that will help or hinder the storytelling ambitions of a movie like this. 
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is currently set to premiere in 2024.]]></summary>

In August, Peloton partnered with Amazon to sell its bikes and other accessories and apparel via the retailer’s website and apps. Today, Peloton announced another partnership with Dick’s Sporting Goods to sell its equipment both online and exclusively in its stores across the US. The partnership marks the first time that its equipment will be readily available for purchase in a third-party retailer’s brick-and-mortar store. 
The move to expand its fitness lineup to physical stores beyond the ones Peloton operates isn’t surprising. It’s continuing a plan to improve operations after a disastrous last 18 months that included layoffs, replacing founder and CEO John Foley with a new CEO, and restructuring. Last month, CEO Barry McCarthy announced another round of layoffs and said Peloton will shut down its in-house retail locations in 2023.


Peloton senior VP Jen Parker said in a press release, “This partnership is a natural fit for our brand and our Member acquisition goals ... Retail remains a critical touchpoint, and we want to provide the in-store experience that many current and prospective Members still covet.” 
In a Q4 earnings report in August, Peloton noted a decline in its membership numbers, a $1.2 billion operating loss, and a 28 percent drop in revenue compared to the same period a year before. 
With this new partnership, current and potential Peloton customers can buy the Peloton Bike, Bike Plus, Tread, Guide, and select accessories. The company said orders made online on Dick’s website will also have home delivery and setup, while “select” orders made in-store can be carried out. There isn’t much information on Peloton or Dick’s website except a list showing some of its over 100 stores in the US that will be included in the rollout, scheduled to start ahead of the holiday season.]]></summary>

Apple’s vice president of procurement, Tony Blevins, has been fired from the company after his crude remarks in a TikTok interview went viral, according to a report from Bloomberg. Earlier this month, creator Daniel Mac posted a video where he asked Blevins what he does for a living, which showed Blevins responding: “I race cars and play golf and fondle big-breasted women. But I take weekends and major holidays off.” 
The video doesn’t identify Blevins by name and doesn’t reference his position at Apple, though Blevins does note that his job offers “a hell of a dental plan.” Mac’s format on TikTok mostly consists of walking up to people in expensive or luxurious cars and asking what they do for a living.

Epic Games is partnering with industry design software giant Autodesk to bring game-like graphics to architecture tools in order to visualize design concepts and plans as more immersive environments. 
While Autodesk architecture software such as Revit is capable of creating 3D design plans, the partnership will introduce easy-to-use tools to designers, with features typically seen more often in game development, such as Unreal Engine, ray tracing, and a huge library of 3D assets to populate environments. 


Anyone subscribed to Autodesk Revit (a building information modeling solution for architects) will now get free access to Epic Game’s Twinmotion, an Unreal Engine-powered real-time visualization tool that’s already being used within the urban planning and cons…]]></summary>

The Federal Trade Commission is facing mounting pressure to block Amazon’s proposed $1.65 billion purchase of iRobot, the company behind Roomba autonomous vacuums.
In a letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan on Thursday, a group of Democratic lawmakers argued that the proposed merger would unfairly bolster Amazon’s dominance in the smart home market by acquiring one of the company’s leading competitors. They also criticized Amazon’s data privacy and security practices following past acquisitions of companies like Ring, including data sharing partnerships with over 600 law enforcement agencies across the country.

Twitter is joining the bandwagon of social media companies copying TikTok’s everlasting scroll of videos. In a blog post on Thursday, the company announced that it’s updating its video player to be “immersive” — tapping on it will make the video full screen, and if you scroll up, you’ll “start browsing more engaging video content.” The company is also adding a video carousel to its Explore tab, which will show you “some of the most popular videos being shared on Twitter.”
The company says its “immersive media viewer” will start to roll out in the iOS Twitter app over the next few days and that the videos on the Explore tab are “currently available to people in select countries” who are using iOS or Android. Both updates are coming to people using the app in English first.

      The Explore tab will now have a section dedicated to videos.
  
While Twitter doesn’t seem to be going all in on copying TikTok like Instagram has, it’s definitely a big change; until this point, videos have mostly been treated as parts of tweets. (Though the somewhat annoying floating livestream player acted as its own thing in certain situations.) Now, they’re becoming their own separate experience; it wouldn’t surprise me at all if we end up getting a dedicated video tab soon, where you’ll automatically be given a starting video to begin your scrolling. The company’s post does say that it wants to make Twitter “the best place for video,” after all.
While TikTok is still a huge deal, social media companies haven’t always found success copying it. For every YouTube Shorts, there’s a yanked Instagram redesign that turned even photo posts into a full-screen scrolling experience, sparking backlash from some of the biggest users on the platform.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nick Barclay / The Verge
    

  
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday that the company is enacting a company-wide hiring freeze and warned them that more downsizing is likely coming. 
First reported by Bloomberg’s Kurt Wagner and confirmed by sources to The Verge, the comments made during an internal all-hands call show how Meta is responding to a decline in its revenue brought on by the slowing global economy and Apple’s ad tracking changes. Meta’s stock price has fallen by more than half this year.
In May, Zuckerberg announced a hiring freeze affecting certain segments of Meta and said he couldn’t make promises about possible layoffs, but by the end of June, his tone had changed. In a Q&A session reported by The Verge, he said, “Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here... And part of my hope by raising expectations and having more aggressive goals, and just kind of turning up the heat a little bit, is that I think some of you might just say that this place isn’t for you. And that self-selection is okay with me.”


Asked about today’s meeting, Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold declined to comment but pointed toward comments from Zuckerberg during the last Meta earnings call, where he said, “Our plan is to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year. Many teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas.”]]></summary>

Google will shutter the game-streaming service in January 2023
 Such is the downstream effect of gaming’s recent pivot away from physical media: Google is shutting down Stadia, its beleaguered game-streaming platform, in January 2023. In other words, if you’re a Stadia user, you’ll effectively be unable to play any Stadia games you own. But hey, at least you can get a refund!
It’s been a rocky three years for Stadia, which Google first rolled out in 2019 to a mix of intrigue and skepticism. Stadia purported to revolutionize the way we play games, allowing players to stream major video games without need of a console or high-end PC. But an anemic game library and a confusing pricing model limited its reach. As such, Stadia never took off like the…]]></summary>

The expansion will introduce the game’s first race and class combination, the Dracthyr Evoker
 World of Warcraft: Dragonflight, the upcoming ninth expansion for the long-running fantasy MMORPG, is set to be released in late November.
In a blog posted on the official World of Warcraft website, Blizzard Entertainment detailed that the expansion will introduce the Dragon Isles, a new environment and the ancestral home of the Dragon Aspects, a new playable race known as the Dracthyr, and a new Dracthyr-exclusive player class known as the Evoker. 
The Evoker is the first race and class combination to come to World of Warcraft, allowing players to switch between a human-like appearance and an anthropomorphic dragon-like form. The expansion will also, naturally, introduce Dragonriding; a new skill-based method of aerial traversal that will allow players to fly on the back of their own personal Drake that can be customized throughout the expansion.
In addition, World of Warcraft: Dragonflight will also introduce new content such as a cast of new characters, raids, and dungeons, as well as new features in the form of a new talent system, an updated profession system, user interface customization, and more.
World of Warcraft: Dragonflight will be released on Nov. 28.]]></summary>

The speech engine Speech Services by Google is being upgraded to improve clarity and make text-to-speech voices in Android apps sound more natural. You can hear the difference between the old voices and the updated voices for yourself through prerecorded snippets on the Android Developers Blog. 
Frankly, while the voices do sound clearer, I’m skeptical about the claims it sounds more natural. It’s also still difficult to ascertain what the first sentence in these US English-language recordings actually says — is this my gun? Is this my god? Apparently, it says, “is this mic on?” but that was lost on me.

All 421 voices in 67 languages within Google’s speech engine are getting a new voice model
All 421 voices in 67 languages within the system are getting a new voice model and synthesizer. The current default voice in “English-US” is changing to one built using “fresher speaker data,” which, alongside other updates, results in a recognizable improvement from the previous default voice. You can also listen to how the updated voices sound in languages such as “Spanish-US” and “Brazilian-Portuguese.” 
The update announcement says that folks already using text-to-speech tech don’t need to do anything to receive the new voices, as “everything will happen behind the scenes” with the updates being downloaded automatically. Its listing on the Google Play Store states that the service is already used by a variety of native applications such as Google Maps, Google Translate, and the Android Recorder app, so chances are that if you use an Android device, you probably already use the Speech Services by Google speech engine even if you don’t know it. The update is rolling out over the next few weeks to all 64-bit Android devices via the Google Play Store.]]></summary>

The next entry in the Planet of the Apes saga will start filming soon — and it has yet another very long name. Today, 20th Century Studios unveiled the first real details on Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which picks up the story years after 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes for what’s described as “an all-new chapter.” Production on the film is scheduled to start next month, with Wes Ball, best-known for the Maze Runner trilogy, serving as director.
We don’t know much else about the movie, and it’s hard to glean a lot from the initial concept art (see above). But the studio did reveal some of the cast, including Owen Teague (Black Mirror and the newer It films), Freya Allen (The Witcher), and Peter Macon (The Orville). The screenplay comes courtesy a team that includes Josh Friedman (War of the Worlds), Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), and Patrick Aison (Prey).
It’s not clear how exactly you’ll be able to watch Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. 20th Century says the movie will be out in 2024 but doesn’t specify a theatrical release, and franchise films from the studio like the Predator spinoff Prey have been released directly on Hulu.]]></summary>

 Warcry came as a big surprise when Games Workshop announced it in 2019. But after the release of Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team, the community was primed for another miniature skirmish game, this time set in the fantasy world of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar. The appeal was similar — a meaty game that only requires a handful of miniatures to play, and a system with the potential for strong narrative campaigns and a bustling competitive scene. The result was a hit with both fans and critics alike. Warcry: Heart of Ghur is the second Warcry box set, released to retail in August, and it marks a simple yet effective revision of what was already Games Workshop’s best ruleset.

The quality of Netflix games has gone from simple, cotton candy-like fluff suitable for short bursts in a waiting room to bespoke, narrative experiences that require hours of strategic thinking. Desta: The Memories Between is the latter. 
Now I’m going to say some words that make sense independently but seem confusing when smashed together: Desta is a dreaming dodgeball roguelike friendship simulator. I promise you, it works.


That’s the thing that enamored me of this game: those disparate words and genres, when put together, frickin’ work on a level that I simply have not seen in a mobile game, let alone one brought exclusively to mobile via Netflix — whose first crop of games included such BAFTA hopefuls like Shooting Hoops and Teeter (Up).

The horror-romance road movie thriller opens in theaters this November
 Timothée Chalamet reunites with Call Me by Your Name director Luca Guadagnino in the first trailer for Bones and All, an upcoming horror-romance thriller set to premiere in theaters this November. The film stars Chalamet as Lee, a young serial killer who falls in love with Maren (Taylor Russell), a runaway on the margins of society who shares Lee’s affinity for cannibalism.
Set to Leonard Cohen’s song “You Want It Darker,” the trailer shows glimpses of Lee and Maren’s trek across Reagan-era America, with the pair driving through picturesque open plains and pouncing on any unsuspecting prey unfortunate enough to cross their path.
There are a surprising number of movies featuring cannibalism, from 2016’s Raw and 2013’s The Green Inferno to The Silence of the Lambs and The Neon Demon. Guadagnino’s film appears to be going the Natural Born Killers route, with Lee and Maren desperately attempting to maintain their relationship despite the obvious violence and emotional volatility rife at the crux of its foundations. We’ll just have to see how fate fares for these two lovers when the film opens in theaters.
Bones and All premieres in theaters on Nov. 23.]]></summary>

While the lock screen is one of iOS 16’s marquee features, there’s another fun addition that’s a little less obvious: the ability to easily cut out subjects from pictures. It’s a way to easily separate a subject from a background and quickly share the results or paste them into applications. What would usually take considerable time and effort when using photo editing software can be done with a couple of easy steps in iOS 16. It’s surprisingly good, and you can easily share the results with your group chat for maximum entertainment. Here’s how it works.
I followed these steps on both an iPhone 11 running iOS 16.0.2 and an iPhone 14 Pro running iOS 16.1 developer beta three.
Open Apple’s Photos app.
Find a picture in your camera roll with a subject that you want to isolate and cut out, like a person, pet, or a prominently featured object.
Long press on the subject until you feel a haptic buzz and see a white border appear, identifying your subject.
From here, tap either Copy or Share.



  
        
      Cats are ideal subjects for this kind of feature.
  

  
        
      You can copy your cutout or share it directly.
  


If you copy the image, you can paste it anywhere that allows you to paste a PNG image file, like Google search, Messages, or even a note. If you tap Share, you’ll see options to AirDrop it, save the image to your camera roll, assign it to a contact, or add it to a new Quick Note, among others.
Essentially, that’s it! For a little more guidance on getting the best results, here are a few tips:
Any image saved to your camera roll is fair game — it doesn’t have to be taken with your iPhone.
It works best with people, pets, or clearly defined objects.
If you long press an image and nothing happens, try again by pressing a different part of the image. If multiple attempts fail, then it probably is just not a good candidate for image cutout.]]></summary>

The film will premiere in U.S. theaters in early 2023
 Makoto Shinkai, the acclaimed anime director behind such films as Your Name and Weathering With You, is returning this fall with a new movie about a young woman who falls in love with a chair. That’s essentially the elevator pitch for Suzume, but there’s a whole lot more going on in the new trailer for the upcoming film, which is slated to release in theaters in Japan this November.
Set in the quiet town of Kyushu, the coming-of-age film follows the story of a 17 year-old girl who finds herself thrust into a magical adventure when she crosses paths with Souta, a mysterious and brooding stranger searching for a mystical door to another world. 
After confiding in Suzume that disaster will befall Japan if these are not closed, Souta is transformed into a sentient chair by a malevolent cat bent on plunging the world into chaos. In order to reverse the curse, Suzume and Souta must work together to track down the cat and close doors scattered across Japan along the way.
As outlandish as the premise might sound, the crux of the story feels very much in line with the rest of the director’s oeuvre. A persistent theme in one form or another across all of Shinkai’s films is the concept of missed connections, of people finding each other in spite of seemingly improbable circumstances, only for those connections to be stymied by equally improbable circumstances outside of their control. I’d say “being turned into a chair by an evil magical cat” falls squarely within the latter description.
Suzume is set to open in theaters in Japan on Nov. 11. The film is set to release in U.S. theaters sometime in early 2023.]]></summary>

While most Latinos rank the economy as a top midterms priority, their opinions on abortion and LGBTQ Americans are much more varied.
 Talk to anyone who closely follows Latino voters — believe me, I’ve talked to a lot in the last few years — and they’ll likely share a similar lesson: America’s political parties, and their candidates’ campaigns, often shoot themselves in the foot by thinking that Latino and Hispanic voters have very different priorities when compared to the average American voter. Voting preference really does often boil down to the economy, health care, and education.
But it’s on social issues where notable excepti…]]></summary>

On paper, there’s little to separate Bowers & Wilkins’ new PX8 headphones from the PX7 S2 model released earlier this year. Battery life is still rated at 30 hours, they still contain six microphones (four for active noise cancellation plus two for calls), and there’s still no dedicated 3.5mm jack.
And yet, the new PX8 costs $699, a whole $300 more than their midrange counterpart. What gives?
Well, B&W argues that “what gives” is its new flagship headphones’ sound quality, thanks to a pair of new 40mm Carbon Cone drive units. These use a similar design to those found in the company’s 700 Series loudspeakers, which start at over $1,000 per pair. “The result is resolution, detail and timing that surpasses the high…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image: Ed Sheeran/The Pokémon Company
    

  
New track will appear in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet
 It’s no secret that singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran is a major Pokémon nerd. He collaborated with The Pokémon Company last year for a “special performance” in Pokémon Go, recently promoted the 2022 Pokémon World Championships in London, and is a known enjoyer of the adorable water-type Squirtle. He professes to playing Pokémon Yellow and Silver on his original Game Boy Color to this day. But Sheeran and Pokémon’s bond is evolving with the release of “Celestial,” a new song that not only features Pokémon in its official video, but will also appear in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.
Sheeran released the “Celestial” music video on Thursday — after teasing it underneath a blanket of Pokémon plush toys two weeks ago — and it raises the question of whether he is OK. In “Celestial,” Sheeran is plagued by Pokémon hallucinations: He has a fry up with Charmander, who helps him make food for all his imaginary Pokémon pals; he’s nearly hit by a London cab, but is spared death by a Snorlax; and after being struck by songwriting inspiration, he hitches a ride home from Charizard. From there, Sheeran goes full anime, and seemingly dies in an explosion caused by Mew and Mewtwo battling.
Fortunately for Sheeran and fans of modern radio-friendly rock, it was all a dream. Or was it the work of Hypno?! Who can say! Regardless, the “Celestial” video is cute, thanks to the inclusion of all those adorable Pokémon and the contribution of illustrator Yu Nagaba — a frequent collaborator of The Pokémon Company — who handled the cartoonish side of Sheeran’s latest project.
Sheeran’s the latest in a long line of pop stars who have rubbed elbows with Pikachu and crew in recent years, including Katy Perry, Post Malone, J Balvin, and Vince Staples, all of whom appeared on last year’s Pokémon 25: The Album.
Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet are headed to Nintendo Switch on Nov. 18.]]></summary>

Stadia ends in January
 Google is officially shutting down its ambitious game streaming project, Stadia, Phil Harrison, the vice president and general manager of Stadia, said in a blog post published Thursday. The announcement comes less than three years after the cloud-gaming console launched.
Stadia will shut down in January 2023.
Harrison said that players who bought Stadia hardware and games will get a refund for their purchases.
“We’re grateful to the dedicated Stadia players that have been with us from the start,” Harrison said. “We will be refunding all Stadia hardware purchases made through the Google Store, and all game and add-on content purchases made through the Stadia store.

The third season of Mythic Quest, the Apple TV Plus show about a group of dysfunctional video game developers, will premiere on November 11th, Apple announced on Thursday. The company’s tweet didn’t share much about what to expect, but you can get an idea of what’s coming in the new season by watching the teaser trailer released in July.
Ian Grimm (played by show co-creator Rob McElhenney) and Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) appear to have followed through on their plan to leave the show’s fictional game studio, and it seems as if they’ll be dabbling with the metaverse. I’m sure nothing will go wrong with that. That said, the trailer also features a few scenes with them back with the rest of the cast, so maybe they won’t be too far away from Mythic Quest (the game) after all. 
A fourth season of the show is on the way as well.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google is shutting down Stadia, its cloud gaming service. The service will remain live for players until January 18th, 2023. Google will be refunding all Stadia hardware purchased through the Google Store as well as all the games and add-on content purchased from the Stadia store. Google expects those refunds will be completed in mid-January.
“A few years ago, we also launched a consumer gaming service, Stadia,” Stadia vice president and GM Phil Harrison said in a blog post. “And while Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” Employees on the Stadia team will be distributed to other parts of the company. 
Harrison says Google sees opportunities to apply Stadia’s technology to other parts of Google, like YouTube, Google Play, and its AR efforts, and the company also plans to “make it available to our industry partners, which aligns with where we see the future of gaming headed,” he wrote.
The writing has been on the wall for Stadia for a while now, most recently when Logitech announced its new cloud gaming handheld last week and Stadia was one of the few cloud gaming services not mentioned. But Stadia has been facing rumors of its demise practically from the start. Google has a habit of killing projects only a few years after they launch, and Stadia, a cloud gaming service from a company with few ties in the gaming industry, seemed like a prime candidate for an early demise.
Last year, rumors abounded it would shut down after the number of games released to the platform slowed and the company shuttered its in-house game development studios. When those rumors popped up again this year, Google insisted that Stadia was not shutting down. “Rest assured we’re always working bringing more great games to the platform and Stadia Pro,” the company said in a tweet. Which was true... until today.]]></summary>

Besides Ghost in the Shell and Akira, that is
 Cyberpunk: Edgerunners has taken the Internet by storm. The latest anime by Studio Trigger and director Hiroyuki Imaishi is based on the universe of Cyberpunk 2077 and Mike Pondsmith’s TTRPG. The 10-episode limited series has not only won the hearts of critics and anime fans alike as one of the best series to premiere this year, but also managed to reinvigorate the game’s fan base in an impressive display of post-launch synergy.
The people have spoken: They want more cyberpunk. And while the anime itself may have reached its natural conclusion, and the first (and presumably last) DLC expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 is still quite a ways away, we’ve scoured our databanks to bring you a list of some of the bes…]]></summary>

Waymo’s latest effort to prove that autonomous vehicles are safer than silly, accident-prone humans involves creating a virtual representation of a hyper-attentive driver and then pitting this fake person against its own AVs in a series of simulated tests to see which is better at crash avoidance. 
(Not to spoil it or anything, but the Waymo vehicle did better.)
Improved safety has been one of the main predictions of the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry. With millions of people dying in auto crashes globally every year, AV operators are increasingly leaning on this safety case to spur regulators to pass legislation allowing more fully autonomous veh…]]></summary>

A new EA blogpost lists a host of changes coming to Dead Space’s remake later this year
 The Dead Space remake is finally coming in early 2023, and it’s bringing with it a beloved feature from 2018’s God of War: the game will play out over one continuous shot for the entire time.
In a new blog post from EA, which takes quotes from some of the key devs working on the remake from EA Motive, the publisher offers some developer insights on the upcoming horror game. There are interesting details about Dead Space’s community council — a group of hardcore fans who helped advise development — and the new graphical effects for shredding enemies. But the most interesting bit of information concerns the game’s camera and its new content.

The electric rat includes the likes of Katy Perry and Post Malone among his inner circle, and now you can add Ed Sheeran to that list.
Sheeran just released his latest music video for the song “Celestial” — not to be confused with Celesteela — and it features notable pocket monsters like Squirtle, Charmander, and Pikachu just hanging out with Sheeran as he goes about his day... before he eventually transforms into a pokémon trainer. The pokémon are all rendered in an adorable cartoon style courtesy of Japanese artist Yu Nagaba.
In a press release, Sheeran explains that he’s been a fan of the franchise since he was a kid. “I still own the same Game Boy Color and play Pokémon Yellow or Pokémon Silver on planes and trains when I’m on tour,” he says. A Game Boy even makes an appearance in the music video. The singer / Game of Thrones star was previously featured in Pokémon Go, and the new song will be in the upcoming games Pokémon Violet and Scarlet, which launch on the Switch on November 18th.]]></summary>

LG’s OLED Flex (LX3), a bizarre 42-inch TV that can transform between a curved and flat TV at the push of a button, now has an official price and release date.

 The Adventure Zone podcast, the popular actual play series featuring the McElroy family, kicks off its fifth full season today. Called Steeplechase, the campaign is set in a fictional theme park in an alternate future Georgia. Unlike some past TAZ seasons, Steeplechase will not use the 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons ruleset. Instead, game master Justin McElroy is relying on John Harper’s Blades in the Dark, another critically acclaimed tabletop role-playing game.
Blades in the Dark was first published in 2017 by Evil Hat Productions. The game is set in the fictional setting of Doskvol, a European-inspired city in the throws of an industrial revolution and plagued by undead spirit…]]></summary>

Players who purchase Goat Simulator 3 on the Epic Games Store can get the skin for free
 Epic Games and Coffee Stain — the studio behind Satisfactory and Goat Simulator — are partnering up for a terrifying Fortnite skin to get you in the mood for scary season. Starting Thursday and running until Sept. 29, 2023, players who purchase Goat Simulator 3 on the Epic Games store will get the “A Goat” skin in Fortnite. 
This Fortnite skin is available now to players who buy the game, even though Coffee Stain won’t launch Goat Simulator 3 until later this year, on Nov. 17. For players who want the skin but aren’t interested in destructive goat shenanigans, “A Goat” will also come to Fortnite’s in-game shop on Nov. 26.

As for the skin itself, it’s a half-human, half-goat hybrid that is truly haunting — Black Phillip himself would be proud. The goat is grey, has a farm tag on its left ear, a crop top, and slacks. Coffee Stain released a trailer to reveal the skin on Thursday, which shows the titular goat from Goat Simulator going through a training montage before essentially jacking into the matrix.
For the uninitiated, Goat Simulator is a sandbox comedy series where you essentially run around and cause mayhem as a goat. And despite the upcoming game having a three after the title, there has actually only been one Goat Simulator so far. Goat Simulator 3 will let players partner up in co-op and cause a wide variety of mischief, from headbutting camera guys to flying off into the sunset with goat jetpacks.]]></summary>

I’m too weak to be mean to Goofy, but Rapunzel’s ‘mother’ is another story
 There’s something really magical about paling around with my childhood heroes — Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, and Goofy — in Disney Dreamlight Valley. It’s like living, for a moment, in a fairytale that I’d designed over and over in my head as a kid. 
I tend to a lush garden growing pumpkins, wheat, and tomatoes with Wall-E. I fish in ponds, streams, and the ocean with Goofy and Moana. I’m swindled every day by Scrooge McDuck, then chastised by Tangled’s Mother Gothel. Most days, I also cook meals in Ratatouille star Remy’s lavish restaurant, before tossing gifts at my favorite of them all, Ariel.

Whether you’re recording a podcast, an interview, a message to a friend, or notes to yourself, audio recording is very easy to do on Windows. There are various third-party apps you can use, but Windows 11 also comes with an app called Voice Recorder preinstalled. 


You can use that to record yourself easily — no download required. You can also use the app for some basic features, including trimming and exporting the tracks. 
Here’s how to use Voice Recorder to record whatever audio you need to. 
How to audio record on Windows 10
Open Voice Recorder. It should come up if you type the name into the search box. If for some reason it’s not showing up, you can download it from the Microsoft Store for free.
Press the microphone button to start recording. It will become a Stop button.
Press the pause button to pause recording; press it again to resume.
Press the Stop button to stop recording. 
The recording will automatically show up on the left side of the screen. Right-click it to rename or share the file. 
How to audio record on Windows 11
The Sound Recorder app on Windows 11 is a bit more sophisticated. It brings a bunch of new features, including the ability to switch microphones from the homescreen and change playback speed.
Open Sound Recorder. It should come up if you type the name into the search box. If for some reason it’s not showing up, you can download it from the Microsoft Store for free.
Press the big red button or press Control + R to start recording. It will become a Pause button.
Press the Pause button to pause recording; press it again to resume. 
Press the Stop button (the big black square) to stop recording.
The recording will automatically show up on the left side of the screen. Right-click it to rename or share the file.]]></summary>

Mental health technology company Headspace Health is calling for researchers to submit proposals for studies on the impact of the company’s tools. The company’s products include both the meditation app Headspace and the digital therapy platform Ginger. 
“We see meditation as both a practice rooted in ancient history and a topic of modern science — which is why we’re just as dedicated to studying it as we are to sharing it with the world,” the company wrote on its “Science at Headspace” webpage. 
In the statement about the program, Headspace Health noted that research has already found benefits for mental health of both the meditation app and the therapy platform. But there’s still a lot that experts don’t know about mental health apps generally — like how they work and who they work best for. Many mental health companies don’t direct research scrutiny at their products at all. 
Interest and use of digital mental health products skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and demand for traditional mental health services (like in-person therapy) still outpaces supply. Digital products can also be more accessible to people looking for support. They can be cheaper for people who don’t have insurance, and many (like Headspace and Ginger) are offered by employers or included in insurance plans. That makes it even more important to closely evaluate these tools and check if they’re actually giving people the support that they promise. 
Researchers interested in using Headspace as part of a study can submit their proposals through an online form. And if they’re not accepted, they’re out of luck — the app’s terms of service say that people cannot use it for any type of research or evaluation “without the express written consent of Headspace.”]]></summary>

In Brazil’s election Sunday, President Jair Bolsonaro could be voted out. Here’s what that means for the Amazon.
 
The Amazon rainforest is at a crossroads. 
Down one path, deforestation continues to accelerate, pushing the iconic forest closer to a dangerous, self-destructing tipping point. On the other, Brazil’s government renews its efforts to protect the Amazon, conserving an enormous amount of biodiversity and carbon.
This weekend, Brazilian voters will help decide which direction the forest takes. On Sunday, the country is holding a presidential election, and the two frontrunners — right-wing…]]></summary>

Subscribers get two bargain-bin Xbox One titles from now on
 With Xbox 360 games retired from Xbox Live Games With Gold, Microsoft is now offering subscribers just two titles per month, for Xbox One and later hardware. And if you don’t recognize October’s titles, well, you’re not alone.
Next month, Games With Gold will be giving out Windbound, which Polygon called a “Moana-meets-Breath-of-the-Wild survival adventure,” when it was announced (and launched) in 2020. 
The second game is Bomber Crew: Deluxe Edition which, despite its cutesy-poo characters and generic box art, is actually something different and substantive. We previewed the game in 2017; in the strategy simulation, players try to keep a World War II bomber flying (and its crew alive) through hell and back. In each harrowing raid, players get to know the personal histories of their crew — more incentive to keep them all alive. If nothing else, you can imagine you’re aboard a B-17 with Kevin Costner and Keifer Sutherland, in Steven Spielberg’s unforgettable Amazing Stories episode from 1985.
Both Windbound and Bomber Crew: Deluxe Edition are Xbox One titles, playable on Xbox Series X. Windbound is available Oct. 1 to Oct. 31; Bomber Crew is available Oct. 16 to Nov. 15.
In addition to these games, subscribers can still get three of September’s Games With Gold: Gods Will Fall, for Xbox One, and Portal 2 for Xbox 360, until Sept. 30; and Double Kick Heroes for Xbox One until Oct. 15.]]></summary>

 Entergalactic, Netflix’s new “television event” from Kid Cudi and Kenya Barris, feels like a project that might not exist were it not for the specific ways that Beyoncé’s self-titled visual album from 2013 and Sony’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse animated feature both captivated the world’s imagination.

Billy Eichner’s star vehicle is great when it’s not reaching for importance
 There’s been a lot of Making History bandied about in the marketing onslaught leading up to the premiere of Bros, the new film written by and starring Billy Eichner. It’s “the first gay romantic comedy from a major studio featuring an entirely LGBTQ principal cast,” with Eichner being touted as “the first openly gay man to write and star in a major studio film.” The oddly self-serious campaign, the kind of buzzy heralding of importance that would typically accompany an award-bait prestige drama, seems to undercut the simple revolutionary act of just making another studio rom-com, this time centered on two dudes in love.

Hey, remember PlayerUnknown? As in PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds or PUBG to your friends? Yeah, well Brendan Greene, aka PlayerUnknown, has provided details surrounding his latest gaming project, codenamed “Artemis,” which aims to be an open-source Earth-sized virtual environment supporting hundreds of thousands of players that can make or play whatever they want.

After a day full of product announcements, Amazon is getting back to cutting prices on its hardware — both new-ish and old-ish. Specifically, there are some great discounts happening once again on the company’s Eero lineup of smart mesh Wi-Fi routers. These prices match the ones that we saw back in early July just before the company launched Prime Day 2022. (Little did we know Amazon was planning another big sale that’s happening soon on October 11th and 12th).

AI text-to-image generators have been making headlines in recent months, but researchers are already moving on to the next frontier: AI text-to-video generators.
A team of machine learning engineers from Facebook’s parent company Meta has unveiled a new system called Make-A-Video. As the name suggests, this AI model allows users to type in a rough description of a scene, and it will generate a short video matching their text. The videos are clearly artificial, with blurred subjects and distorted animation, but still represent a significant development in the field of AI content generation.

 It’s not an exaggeration to say that Sonos customers have been anticipating a product like the Sub Mini for years. Until now, the only way to fully realize a “complete” Sonos home theater system meant coughing up $749 for the Sub subwoofer — on top of whatever you paid for a Sonos soundbar and rear surrounds. That total can quickly balloon to just shy of $2,000 depending on the soundbar you want. For many consumers with Sonos’ step-down products like the Beam and Ray, the Sub was impractically expensive and out of reach.
That’s why there’s now the Sub Mini. First revealed by The Verge back in May, Sonos originally intended to ship the $429 subwoofer well before the October 6th releas…]]></summary>

“Right-to-work” is on the ballot.
 Two midterm ballot measures, in states roughly 500 miles apart, offer two visions of labor rights in America. 
The first referendum, in Illinois, would seek to codify collective bargaining rights in the Illinois constitution. It wouldn’t be the first time a state has done so — New York, Hawaii, and Missouri also have such state constitutional protections — but it would be the first time voters affirm union bargaining rights via ballot measure.

With a slew of smaller tweaks that make for a propulsive shooter
 Yes, it’s true: Overwatch is shutting down on Oct. 2. And after a daylong maintenance period, it’ll be forever replaced with Overwatch 2. But this transition from an original game to a sequel is not like going from The Last of Us to The Last of Us Part 2 — one story is not building upon another. Think of Overwatch 2 as an add-on to the original, with a slew of impactful adjustments.
When Overwatch 2 is released on Oct. 4, players will immediately jump into largely the same competitive and casual queues they’re already accustomed to. There are new maps (quite a few of them) but most of the old ones are playable, too. There’s also a new mode called Push, which is basically an iteration o…]]></summary>

Marilyn Monroe was an artist. Her magnum opus was her own image.
 In 1953, Alfred Kinsey published his highly anticipated new report “Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.” The first edition of Playboy magazine hit newsstands. And three new movies made their premiere, one right after the other, all starring Playboy’s very first cover girl: Marilyn Monroe.
First noirish Niagara, then frothy How to Marry a Millionaire, and finally Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, the movie that would become one of Marilyn’s most iconic. They were the first movies in which Marilyn starred rather than merely appearing as a featured…]]></summary>

The whole thing smacks of ‘content’
 I was somewhat surprised that both Netflix and MSNBC chose to make documentaries about Wall Street Bets, GameStop, and retail traders. The majority of the action takes place online, after all. So what is the visual here? Watching someone type text into a box?
As a result, MSNBC’s feature, Diamond Hands: The Legend of WallStreetBets, and Netflix’s series, Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga, rely heavily on stock footage. In the case of Diamond Hands, this has a ’90s MTV type of vibe; in the case of Eat the Rich, it seems like editors just slapped together whatever was handy and cheap.

China’s catastrophic summer shows its climate adaptation plans still have a long way to go.
 China just finished one of its most disastrous summers on record, with record-breaking heat, drought, and wildfires leading to water shortages even into the fall. More than 900 million people — or about 64 percent of China’s population — faced brutal heat waves alone, highlighting how much further the nation has to go to protect itself against worsening climate-related disasters.

Forget the Force, get pissed instead
 Traditionally in Star Wars, getting pissed off doesn’t get you very far. Like a lot of annoying things in the Star Wars mythos, you can blame the Jedi for this: When your most iconic characters and ideas revolve around cool space wizards who adhere to a strict moral code, stepping outside that code becomes the sole provenance of the bad guys. Where this gets tricky for Jedi is that normal, understandable human emotions become anathema. While expansions to the canon add a bit of nuance — love, for example, isn’t forbidden as much as attachment is, and how it can warp a Jedi’s balance in the Force — more negative emotions like fear and anger are more verboten.

When Mae Sallean was a teenager, her body and mind began to slip away from each other. Her body and face began to sprout thick hair, her voice dropped, and she felt dissociated from her physical form. Something had gone wrong, and she could not reconcile the person she was with the person the world perceived her as. The disconnect left her profoundly depressed and deeply lonely.
Mae knew, somewhere deep down, that she needed to be a girl. She lacked the language for it. In Mae’s heavily religious Texas community, the existence of queer people was barely acknowledged, and trans people, she says, were only seen “in pornography and on Maury.” But she knew, all the same.

Poor communications from Twitch have led to confusion following the service announcing that Chrome, Edge, and Firefox are currently the only web browsers officially supported by the popular streaming platform. No context was provided within the announcement, though it appears the restrictions are temporary and have been placed on alternative browsers so that Twitch can locate and shut down access points being used to create masses of bot accounts.
The issues started when users started experiencing errors when logging into the service. Twitch Support then addressed the situation by asking users to login from an up-to-date version of the three suppo…]]></summary>

Microsoft is making its new version of Outlook for Windows available to all Office testers this week. The new Outlook for Windows app will make the desktop email client a lot more like the web version. Microsoft has been working on this redesign for months, and originally released a semi-public beta earlier this year. 
“Since then, we’ve received valuable feedback from Office Insiders on Beta Channel about how to create a more consistent, feature-rich experience,” explains Margie Clinton, group product manager on the Outlook team. “We’ve been listening to feedback since May and our team has been working diligently to improve the new Outlook for Windows.”

 It’s been a gloomy year for the economy, with high inflation and recession anxieties leading to sharp downturns in the stock market. Tech companies have suffered some of the largest shocks: Netflix’s stock is down more than 60 percent so far this year; Meta’s has fallen about 58 percent. According to Google Finance, Amazon and Google stocks have both dropped around 30 percent year-to-date in 2022.
With tech stocks plummeting, the industry’s billionaire leaders have seen losses to their personal fortunes too. That’s one of the takeaways of this year’s Forbes…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sony is bringing another PlayStation exclusive to PC. Sackboy: A Big Adventure is set to release on PC on October 27th, according to a trailer that was posted early to Sony’s PlayStation Latin America YouTube account. Spotted by Nibel on Twitter, the trailer confirms the PC port of Sackboy: A Big Adventure will be full of improvements.
4K and 120fps support is listed, alongside support for ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio monitors, Nvidia’s DLSS, and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). These are the best improvements to Sackboy: A Big Adventure yet, following a resolution and visuals boost on the PS5 version.
Sackboy is the latest in a line of PlayStation games on PC
Sackboy: A Big Adventure is the latest in a growing line of PlayStation exclusive games on PC. Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launched on PC last month, after Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, and God of War appeared in recent years. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is also launching on PC on October 19th, with Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales arriving on PC at some point this fall.
Sony has been increasingly focused on PlayStation PC ports, and wants around half of its games to be on PC and mobile by 2025. Sony even started using a PlayStation PC label last year alongside acquiring a PC port developer.
The announcement of Sackboy: A Big Adventure on PC comes just a day after a PC version of the Returnal settings menu leaked. Sony confirmed its authenticity by copyright striking the video on YouTube, but the settings video showed support for ray-traced shadows and reflections, and Nvidia’s DLSS. Sony might also be working on its own PlayStation PC launcher, as references to the launcher were discovered in the recent release of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC.]]></summary>

No more using glitches to pull off your designs
 Genshin Impact is more than just an open-world exploration game. In addition to sweeping quests across its massive map, the game also lets you decorate buildings, plants, landmarks and more, in a separate realm called the Serenitea Pot (also known as the Realm Within). It’s a detailed decorating simulator, and a change introduced in the 3.1 patch made it even better by allowing players to overlap decorations. 
The seemingly small change makes a big impact for fans who are super into decorating since it allows for more flexibility. Before this patch, items could not be placed closed together, and instead required a varying amounts of space as a buffer. To get around this, fans had to exploit a shaking glitch where they would wiggle around decorations before placing. The glitch would allow players to place the items within the radius of other decorations. Now, that’s no longer an issue, and players can decorate to their heart’s content. 
  @tikolatte 
Shaking glitch is no more! #sereniteapot #genshinteleport #hoyoversecreators

Genshin Impact has loads of different options for players — some people focus on exploration, others focus on building strong characters, and some focus almost exclusively on decorating their teapot. Known in the community as “teapot mains,” this group of players almost immediately picked up on the change. Now, it’ll be a lot easier for hardcore decorators and casual designers alike to design the Genshin Impact realm of their dreams.]]></summary>

How Hurricane Ian got so powerful — in just two days.
 On Monday morning, Hurricane Ian had wind speeds of 75 miles per hour. Just 48 hours later, those speeds had more than doubled. On Wednesday, as the storm made landfall in southwestern Florida, Ian’s wind hit 155 mph — just shy of a Category 5 storm, the most severe category for a hurricane.
Such rapid growth is known by meteorologists as “rapid intensification.” It’s defined as storms whose wind speeds increase by roughly 35 mph or more in less than 24 hours. “Ian definitely met that criteria,” said Paul Miller, a professor of oc…]]></summary>

Google will finally be sharing more about the Pixel 7 and Pixel Watch at its next Made by Google event
 Google is hosting its next Made by Google launch event on October 6th, where it plans to announce details about the Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel Watch, and new devices from Nest. There will be an in-person event happening in New York City, but the company is also livestreaming the show from its Made by Google YouTube channel.
Google has already revealed the designs of the smartphones and the Pixel Watch, so we expect that the company will share a lot more about what’s under the hood for those devices (like the new Tensor chip for the Pixel phones) as well as any new software features. What’s coming for Nest is a bit more of a mystery, but leaks indicate that one product we might see is a new Nest Wifi Pro.
Catch up with all of our coverage of what’s coming and what’s announced right here. The event kicks off at 10AM ET on October 6th.]]></summary>

Sony’s new PlayStation Stars loyalty program will launch in North and South America on October 5th, the company announced on Wednesday. The new program will let PlayStation fans earn rewards like points and digital collectibles by doing things like playing a game or earning certain trophies. 
Sony has also spelled out some of the finer details of the program, which broadly line up with information we’ve heard before. The service is free to join with an adult PlayStation Network account, and while players can earn some benefits if they are a PlayStation Plus member, you don’t need to subscribe to PlayStation Plus to join Stars. The “full PlayStation Stars experience” will be available via the PlayStation mobile app but not consoles to start; Sony said in September that Stars would expand to consoles “in the future.” 
Some collectibles will be “ultra-rare,” but don’t worry, they’re not NFTs
You’ll be able to earn both loyalty points and digital collectibles via PlayStation Stars. Points will be able to be redeemed for things like PSN funds and certain PlayStation Store items. The collectibles will include things like digital versions of characters and devices from PlayStation’s history, and you’ll be able to display them in a case in the PlayStation app.
Some of the collectibles will be “ultra-rare”; while it’s unclear exactly what it will take to get those, Sony’s blog post says that being the first to get a platinum trophy in certain games as one Stars campaign that’s in the works. But the company stresses that the collectibles are not one of a kind, do not “leverage blockchain technology,” and can’t be resold or traded, so these won’t be PlayStation NFTs, thank goodness. 
PlayStation Stars is beginning to roll out now in Asia (including Japan) and will launch in Europe and Australia on October 13th.]]></summary>

Instagram says it’s permanently removed the official account for Pornhub for violating policies multiple times, Instagram’s parent company, Meta, told Motherboard. 
Meta claims that, over the past decade, Pornhub has repeatedly violated its terms of service regarding nudity, adult content, and sexual solicitation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Verge
    

  
Starting “early next year,” Google will be able to notify you if your personal info, such as your phone number, email, or home address, shows up in search results as part of its “results about you” tool. The announcement comes as Google has officially started rolling out the tool, which lets people easily create takedown requests for results with their personal info. The tool started showing up for some people last week.
In a tweet, the company says the notification system will be opt-in. Ideally, it’s not something that most people will have to turn on; however, it will be nice to have the option, especially for those in high-profile positions or who find themselves targeted by harassment campaigns. 


Early next year, you'll also be able to opt into alerts if new results appear with personally identifying information, so you can quickly request their removal from Google Search… pic.twitter.com/AFQy8bpAkX
— Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) September 28, 2022



It is worth noting, though, that Google is only taking down search results, not the content on the web itself. The information will still be on whatever site is hosting it but will just be harder for people to find.
Google has been letting people request that this sort of search result get taken down for a while now (and has had that ability for results that were intentional harassment or threats even longer), but it’s working to make the process significantly easier to access. The results about you tool lets you flag results with your personal info with a few button taps instead of having to find Google’s specific help article with the link to the form. 
It also gives you a place to track those requests. When notifications for it start rolling out next year, it’ll be even more powerful since you won't have to manually seek out the potentially harmful results to report them.]]></summary>

Verizon and the NFL go way back, and on Wednesday, the two groups announced their next new partnership: NFL Plus, the NFL’s new mobile streaming service, will be one of the streaming services offered on Plus Play, Verizon’s upcoming subscription management platform. 
Verizon first announced Plus Play in March, and to me, it sounds a lot like Apple’s Channels product. With Channels, you can subscribe to streaming services using your information and payment details linked to your Apple ID and manage those services from your Apple ID account instead of trying to remember a bunch of disparate logins. Plus Play seems to be Verizon’s take on a similar idea, but instead, you manage things via your Verizon account. Verizon has already said that partners like Netflix, Peloton, Disney Plus, and HBO Max are on board, and now we can count the NFL among them.
That said, Plus Play still isn’t widely available yet, so if you really wanted to manage your NFL Plus through the platform, you probably can’t. Plus Play is currently in “trials,” according to Wednesday’s press release, and is set to launch in early access “later this year.” 
For years, Verizon was the only place you could stream NFL games on a mobile phone, but that exclusivity ran out in 2017. Now, with NFL Plus, there’s once again a centralized spot to watch NFL games on your mobile phone, and you’ll soon be able to manage that service through Verizon. Teammates for life, I guess.]]></summary>

Microsoft confirmed that it’s removing SwiftKey from the Apple App Store and ending support for the iOS version of the keyboard app on October 5th. It will still be available if you’ve already downloaded SwiftKey on your iPhone, so long as you don’t uninstall it yourself.
“Microsoft will continue support for SwiftKey Android as well as the underlying technology that powers the Windows touch keyboard,” Chris Wolfe, the director of product management at SwiftKey, said in a statement to The Verge. “For those customers who have SwiftKey installed on iOS, it will continue to work until it is manually uninstalled or a user gets a new device.”
The move to discontinue SwiftKey on iOS comes after months of user complaints that seemingly went unresolved. On top of that, users noticed that Microsoft hasn’t updated the SwiftKey app on iOS in over a year, prompting suspicion over whether the app had been quietly discontinued. 
It remains unclear why Microsoft has decided to end support on iPhones. SwiftKey has been available on iOS since 2014, two years before Microsoft acquired the app. SwiftKey will still remain available and fully supported on Android, and Microsoft continues to roll out regular updates. Last year, SwiftKey brought clipboard syncing across Windows and Android devices that use the app but said it’s “not possible to sync your clips to iOS” at the time — and now we know why.]]></summary>

Mandatory, extensive overtime hurts workers, and OSHA may be able to regulate it
 Amber La Macchia was prepared to deal with crunch before she even joined the video game industry — it’s something she heard over and over again while studying game design in college just five years ago.
The practice of crunch — a word that games industry workers use to describe brutal overtime — is well-documented across multiple video game studios. You’d be hard-pressed to find a developer who hasn’t encountered it at least once. The industry has started to reckon with crunch, to better understand just how badly it hurts both workers and video games; studios like Rockstar Games, Activision Blizzard, CD Projekt Red, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga develop…]]></summary>

A prototype all-electric passenger plane took off for the first time yesterday in a test flight that marks a significant milestone for carbon pollution-free aviation. The nine-passenger commuter aircraft called Alice took off at 7:10AM yesterday from Washington state’s Grant County International Airport.
Alice is ahead of much of the pack when it comes to all-electric aircraft under development. It could become the “first all-new, all-electric commercial airplane” if the Federal Aviation Administration certifies it to carry passengers, The Seattle Times reports.

Get ready to lie, bluff, and star in a reality TV show
 The Jackbox Party Pack 9 is another entry in the Jackbox series of party games. Each pack comes with a few simple multiplayer games; players can join a Jackbox session using a browser on a computer or mobile device. These games are popular because they’re so easy to pick up and play with friends, and they make for excellent stream nights or social gatherings with pals. The Jackbox Party Pack 9 will be released on Oct. 20.
This pack comes with a sequel to a Jackbox classic, Fibbage 4. Fibbage, a game about suggesting fake trivia answers to puzzling questions, is one of the series’ most popular games. The pack also debuts four new games.
Quixort, a game with up to ten players, tasks participants with sorting falling answers into the proper categories on a factory floor. Quixort has a single-player mode for those who like trivia and/or Tetris.
Junktopia is for three to eight players, and it asks the players — who have been turned into frogs by a weird wizard — to create backstories for unusual, salvaged objects to be appraised for auction. The frog with the best backstories and most valuable items gets to be a human again. So, y’know, no pressure.
In Nonsensory, three to eight players have to come up with prompts in a drawing, writing, and guessing game. Players then rank each others’ creations on silly scales with subjective attributes.
The most elaborate-looking new game is Roomerang, a reality TV show with four to nine players. Contestants will respond to prompts and engage in role-play to avoid being voted out — although people who are booted can be Roomerang-ed back into the roster to stir up more nonsense.]]></summary>

The last FIFA game adds a lot of new features to the long-running franchise, but I was most excited about cosplaying as Jason Sudeikis and his mustache.
 There are a lot of reasons to be interested in FIFA 23. The latest soccer game from EA includes big features like the unfortunately belated addition of women’s pro leagues from France and England, alongside the return of Italian giants Juventus and general improvements to gameplay and visuals. More importantly, there’s also the nostalgia factor. The FIFA games have been around since the ’90s, and this will be the last entry with the FIFA branding. Starting in 2023, EA is calling its soccer games EA Sports FC. For me, though, my interest in FIFA 23 was something much more bas…]]></summary>

TikTok took down more than 113 million videos between April and June of this year, according to the company’s quarterly transparency report published today.
Though the number of videos the platform removed for policy violations is up slightly from the first few months of 2022, it’s just a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of content shared on TikTok. The 113 million represents just 1 percent of total videos uploaded during the three-month period.
The most common reason for removal was violating policies around minor safety, which accounted for just under 44 percent of videos taken down. Other common reasons include illegal activities and regulated goods, as well as adult nudity and sexual activities, according to the report.

Though Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem is one of the most fascinating and thought-provoking pieces of speculative fiction to come out in recent years, you wouldn’t know it judging from the way that Netflix has (barely) been talking about 3 Body Problem, its forthcoming adaptation of the novel from Alexander Woo, D.B. Weiss, and David Benioff
During this year’s Tudum, essentially all of Netflix’s larger profile projects due out in the coming months, like Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, and The Witcher’s third season, were spotlighted in segments that gave you a sense of what sort of energy their respective creative teams were working with.

Say you twisted your ankle on the trail, you’re out of cell signal range, and you need to call for help. Sounds like a great time to learn how to use a new feature on your phone, right? Hell no, and it seems that Apple has come to the same conclusion. Sleuths at 9to5Mac discovered some code in the latest iOS 16 developer beta that hints at the existence of a satellite SOS demo mode, potentially so you can get familiar with the feature before you get into trouble.
SOS via satellite is the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro-only feature Apple announced (and demo’d for us) earlier this month. It uses satellite connectivity to help relay messages and location info to emergency services when you’re out of cell range. It’s not live yet; the feature is expected to arrive in November. 


In the meantime, Apple seems to be laying the groundwork for its official launch. 9to5Mac found “multiple features” in iOS 16.1 developer beta 3 related to satellite connectivity, but the demo mode stands out as something we hadn’t heard about before. This satellite demo seems like a legitimate walkthrough, too, that requires you to go outside and find a clear view of the sky to use it. 9to5Mac reports that it will be available anytime from the settings menu.
Apple is far from alone in pursuing ways to connect phones to satellites, but it’s still a very new concept to most people. A demo mode could help iPhone 14 owners get familiar with the feature and how it works — or maybe help convince them that it’s worth paying for. Apple will include two years of service on the iPhone 14, but after that, it’s unclear how much it will cost.]]></summary>

Verizon is teasing that it’s working on a 5G gaming handheld with Razer and Qualcomm, which is set to be fully announced on October 15th at RazerCon. The carrier talked a little about the device, which will be called the Razer Edge 5G, at a keynote at MWC Las Vegas, saying that it’ll run Android and give you access to cloud gaming services like Xbox Cloud Gaming. Unlike devices like Logitech’s recently announced G Cloud, however, it does seem like it’ll be able to play games stored locally on the device as well.
While details are relatively sparse, we have heard of a similar device before: Qualcomm’s Snapdragon G3x Handheld Gaming Developer Kit. That device, which was shown off late last …]]></summary>

 10 years ago this week, Rian Johnson’s Looper burst into theaters with the sheer ventilating force of a blunderbuss shot.
The sci-fi action-thriller starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, which follows an assassin forced to fight a future version of himself, was a far cry from the director’s past films like Brick and The Brothers Bloom. Looper would amass such critical and commercial success that Johnson would be offered the opportunity to write and direct the second installment in Disney’s Star Wars sequel trilogy.
There are many things to admire when looking back on the production of Looper, like the film’s sobering depiction of a dilapidated Kansas City slouch…]]></summary>

The House is expected to vote on a package of previously uncontroversial bills targeting Big Tech’s market dominance this week, but a sudden flare-up among Republicans is threatening to hold up any movement on the bills. 
Earlier this week, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) announced that the House planned to vote on three bills that would make it more difficult and expensive for large tech companies, like Apple or Google, to acquire smaller companies by increasing filing fees. In turn, those fees would be used to fund investigations for federal antitrust enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department.

The internet is more visual and more interactive than ever. So how does the world’s biggest search engine change to fit the times? By redefining the whole idea.
 Google is trying to blow up how you think about search. To say it’s pivoting to compete in a world where TikTok and Instagram are changing the way the internet works would be an overstatement… but not a big one. Google now exists on a more visual, more interactive internet, in which users want to be surprised and delighted as often as they just want an answer to their questions. In that world, what is a search engine even for? The Google you see tomorrow might not be completely different, but the change is already starting.

Google wants its search engine to become the place where you do your online shopping. To do that, the company announced today that it’s introducing a set of new shopping-specific features meant to help you narrow down your results and — more importantly — keep you on Google.

Breaking it down Riker-style
 Trombone Champ is a delightfully silly game that asks players to match the beat with their snazzy trombone. It’s a game that immediately inspires fun gifs and clips; it’s just great to have your little cartoon avatar go absolutely ham on a trombone cover of the national anthem or the solo trombone version of a epic orchestral symphony. Rudeism, a streamer known for creating novelty controllers, has taken a crack at the ultimate Trombone Champ controller.


Here, we can see the controller in action: It’s a peripheral of an actual, factual trombone, complete with slide capabilities and some hearty doots. It’s not great as hearing the trombone serving as a proper instrument, but it is the most immersive way to rack up some Trombone Champ high scores.
BEHOLD, THE TROMBONE CONTROLLER
Ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting. If only I knew how to play it IRL  
The ultimate way to play Trombone Champ @HolyWowStudios pic.twitter.com/Lvm5m2CT44
— Rudeism (@rudeism) September 27, 2022



Rudeism made a short video of the trombone controller that shows how it works. An ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a built-in microphone captures his trumpet sounds. It’s absolutely beautiful. Rudeism has made a career out of gaming with these great peripherals, pulling off tricks like playing Rocket League with a guitar controller, playing as Overwatch’s French sniper Widowmaker with a controller baguette, and beating FromSoftware’s massive open world adventure Elden Ring with a Fisher Price controller.
Rudeism streams on Twitch, where you can catch his experimental stylings live. Sometimes he just relaxes with some Fall Guys, and sometimes he plays Untitled Goose Game in a giant goose suit. Variety is, after all, the spice of life.]]></summary>

Blink’s giving its blocky Mini security camera a new robot body. The new Mini Pan Tilt is a very literally named mounting accessory that converts your existing Blink Mini camera from a stationary device into a controllable camera that lets you look around the room.
Setup sounds like it’ll be easy for the Pan Tilt: you connect the Mini camera to the mount, plug in the Micro USB cord, and the camera now has 360-degree movement from the Blink app. You can even install it on a tripod or wall mount (not included), or you can just place it on a table.


You can preorder the Mini Pan Tilt mount today on Amazon for $29.99. There’s also a bundle that gets you the mount as well as a Blink Mini camera if you don’t have…]]></summary>

Since the start of the pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration has signed off on 430 COVID-19 tests through its emergency use authorization powers — rules that let the agency push tests and drugs out the door more quickly during an emergency. Now, over two years later, the agency is backing off that system and will treat most COVID-19 tests just like other medical tests. In a statement Tuesday, the FDA said that most new COVID-19 tests will have to go through the normal, non-emergency test review process. 
“For most new tests, shifting to traditional premarket review would best meet the public health needs at the current stage of the COVID-19 public health emergency,” said Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in the statement.
The emergency use authorization system lets the FDA review and authorize tests quickly, which was key during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when there weren’t nearly enough tests available to meet skyrocketing demand. It’s how we got the original tests that used deep nasal swabs to find the coronavirus, and it’s how all of the rapid at-home tests made it to drug store shelves. But now, there are plenty of COVID-19 tests available, the FDA said in its statement. There isn’t as much of a crush, so the agency can take more time reviewing new tests and give them full, formal approval. 
The United States is still under a federal public health emergency, so the FDA can still use the emergency use authorization process if it feels it needs to. In the statement, the agency said it will still use that process in a few cases — like for tests that use new technologies, or for tests that diagnose a new variant.
But for other COVID-19 tests, the process will go back to normal. It’s another signal that federal agencies are shifting to make COVID-19 part of the normal public health backdrop, rather than an acute emergency.]]></summary>

If you open up Google Maps right now, I’m guessing you’ll probably search for where you want to go using a traditional 2D map. But Google has some ideas to help you discover the world around you in a far more immersive way, and it showed off some of what it’s working on at its Search On event on Wednesday.
One of those new features is what Google calls Immersive View, which it first demonstrated at this year’s Google I/O. On its face, it’s essentially a 3D aerial view of a certain area or location — think Apple Maps’ Flyover feature — but Immersive View also lets you go a level deeper by checking out weather, traffic, and even drill down to explore individual buildings. During Wednesday’s show, Google Maps VP and GM Chris Phillips gave a brief aerial tour o…]]></summary>

AI software monitoring sounds from within bright yellow buoys could reduce whale deaths by identifying whale species and pod locations. Scientists then verify the data and relay that information to any ships passing nearby, helping them to avoid the animals. The Whale Safe project was launched by Benioff Ocean Science Laboratory and partners, with the first Whale Safe systems already deployed in the Santa Barbara Channel near the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.
Each buoy carries an onboard computer that records whale sounds using an underwater microphone. An AI algorithm then detects the clicks and squeals of specific whale speci…]]></summary>

The undersea explosions in two gas pipelines from Russia exposed Europe’s vulnerabilities — just as the continent faces a looming energy crisis.
 European and NATO officials are blaming sabotage for three leaks in the Nord Stream 1 and 2 undersea pipelines running from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. EU officials did not dd anyone directly, but the allegation underscored the uncertainty around Europe’s energy standoff with Russia, and how volatile the continent’s energy security is as winter approaches.

With multisearch, you can open up Google Lens in Google’s Android or iOS apps, snap a pic of the jacket, type out the color you want to find the jacket in, and search.

Amidst a slew of new hardware announcements today, Amazon is also announcing a host of new capabilities for Alexa, including a handful of new smart home features. The company hasn’t announced exact release dates for the updates, but its press release says it hopes to roll them out “over the coming months.”
It might sound like a small change, but one of the more significant upgrades is the ability to quickly and easily schedule smart home device actions for moments in the future. Although it’s previously been possible to schedule actions via the Alexa app, now the process is a lot simpler, thanks to voice commands like …]]></summary>

A new official after-school kit rolls out the initiative
 Gone are the days of crowding around a wobbly card table in the basement or a trying to find some space in a cluttered dining room. Kids’ first Dungeons & Dragons adventures can now take place in their school library or the classroom itself thanks to a robust new educational initiative from Wizards of the Coast.
D&D’s new educator resources include a brand-new kit for teachers and parents who run after-school clubs, along with webinars from experts discussing how the role-playing game improves both emotional and basic literacy skills. An official curriculum aimed at grades four to eight is also being released this month. All are free.

OpenAI has scrapped the wait list for access to its text-to-image system DALL-E 2, meaning anyone can sign up to use the AI art generator immediately.
The company unveiled the original DALL-E in January 2021, with the tool impressing both AI experts and the public with its ability to turn any text description (or prompt) into a unique image. Since then, a number of other text-to-image systems have been created that rival the speed and quality of DALL-E. Other systems, like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, are much easier for anyone to access, drawing attention away from OpenAI’s own offering.

Amazon’s first self-branded TV sets were aimed squarely at budget shoppers and prioritized value and good software over sheer picture quality. The Fire TV Omni lineup runs the same software as the company’s popular streaming device — offering access to endless entertainment apps — and the built-in microphones allow for hands-free Alexa voice commands. Today, Amazon is announcing the latest edition to its TV series, the Fire TV Omni QLED, and this time, it’s stepping up the display specs with the inclusion of full-array local dimming. 


Starting at $799.99 and coming in 65- and 75-inch ($1,099.99) sizes, the Fire TV Omni QLED includes “up to” 96 individual dimming zones…]]></summary>

 In the right hands, Lego sets are a form of storytelling. Whether following the prescribed on-the-box exploits of pirates, explorers, and starship captains or scrapping the instruction booklets to mix and match into genre-bending adventures, kids and adults alike have spent the last half-century constructing stories alongside their blocky structures. The artists involved with LEGO in Focus, a new photography book from Chronicle Books, take that form of play one step further.
For LEGO in Focus, 30 photographers from around the world grabbed their Lego minifigs to stage surreal setups that range from mundane scenes of everyday life to the microscopically fantastic. Polygon’s exclusive …]]></summary>

 SC Johnson’s administration building and research tower in Racine, Wisconsin, have become legendary as corporate headquarters buildings. 
As the above video shows, the administration building’s “Great Workroom” is a stunning example of architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s unique approach to office design. They were built ahead of their time, the precursor to corporate campuses like Apple Park and the Googleplex. 
But what did it really feel like? Vox’s Phil Edwards visited the headquarters to find out — and actually try to work there. First, he visited Wright’s nearby Hardy House, an earlier design that features many of the same Wright signatures found in the SC Johnson building, from custom-designed furniture to ideas about compression and expansion.
Watch our video to follow Phil and see what it really feels like to work in such a space.

The company’s annual September events are usually a marathon of new product launches. We’ll be covering the announcements live.
 Amazon has used its past September events to announce a flying camera drone, a home robot, and an Alexa-enabled microwave. Needless to say, it’s hard to predict what the company has in store at its annual event, but we can be certain there’ll be a lot of products on tap. Chances are high we’ll see updated devices in the Echo lineup, plenty of new things that work with Alexa, and likely some announcements involving other big Amazon brands too, from Fire TV to Ring and Eero.
The event is being held virtually via livestream, but it’s available to watch on an invite-only basis. If you want to keep up on the event as it happens, we’ve got you covered: The Verge staff will be tuned in and reporting from the event live, so you can stick around to be filled in as details are announced.
Amazon’s livestream starts today at 12PM ET / 9AM PT, and our live blog will kick off shortly before then. We can’t say for sure that we’ll get another gadget as glorious as the Alexa-powered Big Mouth Billy Bass, but you never really know what Amazon has in the works.

Square now lets merchants use Apple’s Tap to Pay feature to process transactions. In a press release, the company announced that sellers with a compatible iPhone can use Square’s Point of Sale (POS) app to accept contactless payments.
Apple first rolled out Tap to Pay on the iPhone XS and newer in February. The feature transforms the iPhone into a contactless payment terminal, letting users tap their iPhone or an NFC-supported credit/debit card against the seller’s device to complete a transaction. It also supports Google and Samsung Pay for users on Android. Stripe was the first payment company to launch support for the feature, with Square rolling out a limited beta program in June. Square says sellers with an iPhone 11 or newer that runs iOS 15.5 or later can access the feature.
Now that Tap to Pay support is widely available with Square, sellers who want to process transactions won’t necessarily have to use the company’s card reader dongle, which attaches to a mobile device via the headphone jack or Lightning connector. That said, this likely doesn’t mean the dongle’s going away for good, as some sellers and buyers might not have a compatible phone to access the feature in the first place.]]></summary>

Ubisoft Singapore just cannot get the pirate sim out of drydock
 Skull & Bones, Ubisoft Singapore’s ambitious but beleaguered open-world pirate adventure, is delayed again. The publisher says it will now launch March 9, 2023.
Ubisoft announced the delay on Wednesday; Skull & Bones had been slotted for a Nov. 8 launch on Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. 
“While the game development is finished at this stage, the extra time will be used to further polish and balance the experience using players’ feedback from our Technical tests and Insider Program which happened over the past two weeks,” Ubisoft said in a statement. “This is the right decision both for our players and for the long-term success of the game as March 9, 2023 provides for a suitable release window for this very unique new brand.”
Skull & Bones was announced at E3 2017, but development on it may be traced back to 2013’s pirate-themed Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag. Originally given a late 2018 launch window, it has been delayed four times over the past four years.


Ubisoft Singapore, despite a lengthy project that Kotaku reported in 2021 had cost more than $120 million, appeared to turn a corner this summer when it hosted a one-hour gameplay reveal livestream and confirmed Nov. 8 as Skull & Bones’ launch date.
Set in the Indian Ocean in the 17th century, on a map stretching from the east coast of Africa to Malaysia, Skull and Bones puts players in the role of a pirate captain seeking to make a name for themselves. Starting with a tiny ship and a spear, they’ll quickly work their way up to commanding larger vessels and crews, managing the ongoing threat of mutiny and finding enough food and plunder to placate everyone.]]></summary>

The newest Kindle is the first truly new Kindle in years. It’s called the Kindle Scribe, and it’s both a reading device and a writing one. With a 10.2-inch E Ink screen, a stylus that attaches to the side of the device, and a bunch of new software, the $339.99 Scribe is trying to be as much a tablet as an ebook reader. It’s available for preorder today, and Amazon promises it’ll be out before the holidays. It’s also the kind of device people have been waiting for Amazon to make for years.


Kevin Keith, a vice president of product and marketing at Amazon, says the display is the reason the Scribe took so long. “This is the first 300ppi, front-lit display that has an adjustable warm light,” he says over Amazo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Commonwealth, explained.
 After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom; she was also still the leader of an organization that, on a map, looks a lot like the British Empire.
The British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the monarchy made a play to keep ties and preserve their global influence by allowing newly independent republics to join the Commonwealth, too. The only catch: They had to accept the queen as the leader of the organization. With her death, this vestige of the British Empire is now under the leadership of King Charles III. So what exactly is the Commonwealth? Why is it still here? And will it survive?

Chelsea Lane was the head performance therapist with the Golden State Warriors when she first started checking her athletes with a product from NeuroSync, a neurotechnology company making a tool that tracks eye movements to understand brain health. Lane initially used it as part of the team’s concussion protocols. But when she moved to the Atlanta Hawks in 2018, she started using the information in another way: to try and understand how well her athletes were sleeping. 
“I had some freedom to explore the idea that — whilst not its intended purpose — I might just have tech in my hands that could help me better understand and manage fatigue in my over-worked and under slept population by tracking their eye function,” Lane, now the head of high performance at Basketball New…]]></summary>

This Friday, Elon Musk is expected to unveil a prototype of his Optimus robot — better known as the Tesla Bot. When Musk announced last August that Tesla was developing a general-purpose robot capable of handling “unsafe, repetitive or boring” tasks, the reaction from experts was skeptical. A year on and not much has changed, with roboticists telling The Verge that we’re a long way off building a robot that can outright replace human labor.
That doesn’t mean, though, that they’re not excited to see what Tesla has come up with.

Superheroes, Hot Wheels, and Superhot
 Injustice 2, Hot Wheels Unleashed, and Superhot will be offered to PlayStation Plus Essential subscribers beginning Oct. 4, Sony announced on Wednesday. 
Hot Wheels Unleashed (for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5) is the newest game of the three, launching a year ago. Milestone’s racer isn’t necessarily a kart game — it employs strong racing physics as well as arcade-racing mechanisms like turbo boosts. It was a Polygon Recommends selection when it launched in September 2021.
Injustice 2, for PS4, from Mortal Kombat maker NetherRealm Studios, launched in 2017 and is the sequel to the 2013 DC Universe fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us. There was also a companion comic book series explaining the somewhat convoluted story that had Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all duking it out among one another.
Superhot, from the eponymous Superhot Team, began life in early 2016 as a puzzle/action game for Windows PC, quickly moving to Xbox One and Oculus virtual reality adaptations. In it, players control a stylized action hero who has to think his way through a bullet-time fight with numerous adversaries. In Superhot, time only moves when the player does, giving them plenty of opportunity to think about their next move in a John Wick-style badass sequence. The PlayStation 4 version of Superhot launched in 2017.
PlayStation Plus subscribers can still pick up September’s Essential-level games — Need for Speed: Heat, Granblue Fantasy: Versus, and Toem — through Oct. 3.]]></summary>

Amazon’s hardware launch event is less than an hour away, and we’re already seeing images of some upcoming products make their way around the web ahead of time. Leakers posted images of the purported devices on Twitter, which include an alleged Amazon Fire TV, a new Kindle that comes with a stylus, and a potential look at the Echo Auto 2.
One leaker, SnoopyTech, claims Amazon will release a new Kindle called the “Scribe” that allows users to take notes directly on the screen using a supported stylus, making the device handy for more than just reading. The images shared by SnoopyTech indicate users can access a note-taking interface that lets them erase text, as well as undo or red…]]></summary>

Square Enix’s experimental year continues
 Some friends and I have a saying about video games: “Less talk-y, more do-y.” It’s an extremely broad (and sometimes refutable) criticism aimed at the fact that, more often than not, video games are better when they let their gameplay speak for them. The DioField Chronicle is the latest champion of this sentiment.
Released last week, The DioField Chronicle is yet another in Square Enix’s wealth of 2022 releases. Billed as a tactical RPG, it eschews the turn-based grid combat of a Fire Emblem, XCOM, or Final Fantasy Tactics, opting instead for real-time battles on freeform maps. As Oli Welsh pointed out in August, it plays sort of like a MOBA. My own playthrough unfolded like an A-Team training montage as I swa…]]></summary>

Progressive web apps on Windows look more like native Windows apps than ever before. Thanks to a new feature that Microsoft just announced, the Window Controls Overlay, developers can now customize the title bar of their PWAs. 
Previously, web apps did not have access to this feature, which could lead to empty space, clashing colors, and other oddities that made some PWAs look decidedly un-app-like. The new feature should help developers fix these problems. Web apps now have access to the “full surface area” of their app window, excluding only the buttons in the top-right corner — minimize, etc. remain untouchable.

Omega Force’s Wild Hearts launches in February 2023
 Publishers Electronic Arts and Koei Tecmo and Dynasty Warriors series developer Omega Force revealed a new take on the monster-hunting genre on Wednesday: Wild Hearts, an action-focused hunting game set in fantasy feudal Japan, where players will battle giant “nature-infused beasts” called Kemono.
Differentiating Wild Hearts from Capcom’s Monster Hunter series is a mechanic called Karakuri, which are described as “sophisticated mechanisms crafted from a lost, ancient technology.” As seen in the debut trailer for Wild Hearts, those Karakuri include things like fantastical giant mallets, ballistae, and bombs that can handicap, stun, or damage giant creatures. Of course, players will al…]]></summary>

Though Marvel’s upcoming Blade reboot starring Mahershala Ali was meant to start production this year ahead of its debut next fall, the movie’s just hit something of a significant hiccup with the unexpected departure of director Bassam Tariq.
In a statement to The Hollywood Reporter last night, Marvel attributed Tariq’s Blade exit to “continued shifts in our production schedule” and thanked him for his contributions to the project thus far. In his own statements, Tariq echoed the studio’s sentiments about their working relationship having been a good one and expressed his eagerness “to see where the next director takes the film.”
Details about the new Blade have been surprisingly sparse since the project was first announced to much fanfare back at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, and it wasn’t until last year’s Eternals that the studio began teasing out how the daywalking vampire might pop up in the MCU. While it’s always notable when a director dips out of a movie like this, it also isn’t all that uncommon or surprising given how far out from their actual production start dates these things are always announced. In the same way that the new Fantastic Four movie found Matt Shakman to direct after Jon Watts’ exit, it won’t be long before someone steps up to the plate and gets ahold of Blade, which is still slated to hit theaters on November 3rd, 2023.]]></summary>

Production was set to begin on the MCU installment in November
 Marvel Studios’ forthcoming Blade reboot has lost its director, Bassam Tariq, less than two months before production was expected to begin, Variety reported Tuesday. The departure could complicate the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s packed schedule, which has Blade premiering Nov. 3, 2023.
Tariq confirmed to Variety he was out as director; but the trade also reported that Tariq is still attached to the project as executive producer. “Eager to see where the next director takes the film,” Tariq told Variety.
Blade, a reboot of Wesley Snipes’ vampire-hunting cult hit from 1998, was revealed at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. It is slated to be part of the MCU’s “Phase 5,” announced at SDCC this past July. 


Although this film is part of the overall MCU, Blade is a key figure among the super-monsters subgenre that Marvel Comics spun up in several 1970s publications, including crossovers with The Amazing Spider-Man. The most recent screen adaptation from this line of heroes and villains was March’s poorly received (and non-MCU Sony Pictures adaptation) Morbius.
That said, Marvel Studios keeps its releases on a tight schedule and often teases or links them up narratively, in post-credits sequences or the films themselves. If Tariq leaving Blade as director delays the movie overall, it could affect other Phase 5 movies, like May 2023’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 or The Marvels, planned for July 28, 2023.
Blade made his first MCU appearance with actor Mahershala Ali’s voice-over in a post-credits sequence for 2021’s Eternals, in which Blade speaks to The Black Knight, Dane Whitman (played by Kit Harington).]]></summary>

We can’t tell what’s a joke anymore
 In true Deadpool fashion, Ryan Reynolds bypassed Marvel’s giant San Diego Comic-Con and D23 events and instead updated fans on the status of Deadpool 3 via a quippy video on Twitter. On Tuesday, Reynolds announced that not only was the Deadpool sequel officially in the works at Marvel Studios (after being in limbo in the wake of Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox), but the Merc with a Mouth would bring one of his X-Men friends along for the ride: Wolverine. Despite retirement, Hugh Jackman would pick up his claws one more time for Deadpool 3.
The news immediately raised questions about what the heck Deadpool 3 would be about, and when it would take place. Jackman’s run as Wolverine ended definitively — as far as comi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this month, EA announced that it was partnering with Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force on a Monster Hunter-style action game. Today, the companies finally showed off the first trailer for the title, which has been dubbed Wild Hearts (not to be confused with the excellent indie game Sayonara Wild Hearts). It’s described as “an epic adventure set in a fantasy world inspired by feudal Japan,” and the first footage shows gameplay that looks faster than Monster Hunter, with inventive traps, sweeping locales, and some truly vicious beasts. The game will be playable solo or via “seamless co-op.”
Here’s the basic premise, per EA:
Wild Hearts takes place in Azuma, a fantasy landscape inspired by feudal Japan, that is now rampaged by the once peaceful Kemono — altering their environment at the cost of citizens’ lives. The Kemono range from plant-infused squirrels to the massive Kingtusk wild boar. After a dreadful fight with the winter wolf Deathstalker, players become bearers of a life-sustaining technology and are compelled to restore balance across the region. 

The fact that EA is entering the hunting genre is no surprise, given the success of Monster Hunter World. First released in 2018, the more open-ended take on the long-running series went on to become the best-selling release in Capcom’s history, selling more than 18 million copies across multiplatforms. (And it’s on top by a large margin: Capcom’s second best-selling game is Resident Evil 7, with 11 million units.) To date, though, there has been little in the way of competition to MonHun’s unique style of action.
While Omega Force is best known for the Dynasty Warriors franchise, the studio has steadily expanded into creating spinoffs for some of the biggest franchises in gaming, including The Legend of Zelda and Fire Emblem.
Wild Hearts is launching on February 17th, 2023, on the PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.]]></summary>

 True crime has always been complicated, morally speaking. At a minimum, it takes the real stories of victims, their families, and their killers and repackages them as entertainment for the public’s consumption. 
Should we expect a person impacted by a crime to be okay with having their story trotted out for the general public? Does it matter if they aren’t?

As well as accessibility options and improved UI tied to the game’s PS5 and Xbox Series X release
 Developer Supermassive Games and publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment announced on Wednesday that Man of Medan, the first installment in the interactive survival-horror drama series The Dark Pictures Anthology, will receive new free content in the form of a new chapter called, “Flooded,” featuring new gameplay and player deaths added to the climax of the game. 
Not only that, but both Man of Medan and Little Hope, the second game in The Dark Pictures Anthology, have received a free update in the form of improved UI, updated art and event triggers, accessibility options, and other additions tied to the game’s release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X this week. Bandai Namco said the updates provide players “an even greater immersive experience.”
The Dark Pictures Anthology is a series of stand-alone, branching cinematic horror games in the vein of Supermassive’s other titles, like 2015’s Until Dawn and 2022’s The Quarry. 
In our review of Man of Medan, Polygon’s Austen Goslin wrote that “While the characters and their relationships feel detailed and fleshed out, Man of Medan’s overall story never quite manages to make it beyond its ghost-ship premise.” Polygon’s Cass Marshall wrote in their review of Little Hope that that game “fails to capture the Shared Story magic that the previous game in the Dark Pictures Anthology, Man of Medan, managed to pull off.”
In addition to PS5 and Xbox Series X, Man of Medan and Little Hope are available for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One.]]></summary>

 There are two main reactions to Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro, which will be available September 23rd for the same $249 as the original pair released in 2019. 
The first is “that’s it?” Apple has left the overall design and in-ear fit practically unchanged. The new AirPods Pro look identical to their predecessors. Despite arriving nearly three years after the first model, there’s been no major revamp. No shortened or eliminated stems. No new color choices. From a side view of your head, these are the same AirPods Pro as ever. It’s easy to be underwhelmed.
Rather than reinvent its wireless earbuds, Apple focused on improving everything about the formula that’s already pro…]]></summary>

Just a little bit of Wiglett revealed
 The Pokémon Company revealed a sort-of-new Pokémon coming to Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet this November: Wiglett, a Paldean region-spin on the lovable ground-type, Diglett. Wiglett is long, white, and loves hanging out on the beach.
Wiglett was revealed in a somewhat unusual fashion, as part of a faux Zoom call between members of the World Ecological Pokémon Society, which is being shown a presentation on the Paldean region by Jacq, the player’s homeroom teacher in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. During the video, various biomes and Paldean Pokémon are shown, including another newcomer, Paldean Wooper. Society members remark on Wiglett’s appearance, likening it to a region-specific version of Diglett — even though it is apparently a separate species.
Whether Wiglett will evolve into another form — as Diglett does into Dugtrio — is unknown. You can watch the Wiglett reveal in this video uploaded by Serebii, if you don’t want to sit through the entire World Ecological Pokémon Society presentation. 
Pokémon Scarlet and Violet will be released Nov. 18 for Nintendo Switch. The newest mainline game will introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon and the new Paldean region. Players will be able to catch brand-new Pokémon like Armarouge, Ceruledge, Klawf, Grafaiai, Fidough, Paldean Wooper (aka Pooper), Cetitan, Cyclizar, Smoliv, Lechonk, and Pawmi. Those new creatures join Scarlet and Violet’s new starters Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly, and two new Legendary Pokémon (Koraidon and Miraidon), in the series’ Pokédex.]]></summary>

While we have an idea of what to expect, Google may still have a few surprises in store. Here’s everything we’re looking forward to at the upcoming Google Pixel event.
The Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro to arrive with incremental upgrades
There wouldn’t be a Pixel launch event without a new generation of Pixel smartphones. We’re going to see what Google has in store for the Google Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, which Google offered a brief glimpse of during I/O back in May.

Mon Mothma isn’t a hero Cassian would respect — yet
 As we see in this week’s Andor, Mon Mothma is far from the height of her powers. Though seen only briefly in the Star Wars films, the Republic leader’s legacy looms large: She’s one of the few to stand against Supreme Chancellor Palpatine during the final days of the Republic; she secretly helped found the Rebel Alliance; and eventually she became the leader and face of the organization. But in Andor she is only partway on that journey. Here Mon Mothma is just a senator, surreptitiously working to fight against the very fascist regime she’s trapped within.

Believe it or not, Dylan Field tells me over Zoom this week, when he started Figma he was only thinking about one thing: making cool design tools. In was 2012, and Field and co-founder Evan Wallace had the idea of building design software for the web browser — making the design process live, interactive, and collaborative — in ways it hadn’t really been in software before.
The idea was much easier to imagine than it was to build. Figma was building in stealth mode for three years before its first public preview, but the hard technical work paid off. Figma was a hit with designers almost immediately, as the real-time collaboration it enabled made design processes — particularly software design processes — much more efficient than they had …]]></summary>

Get the latest news on Amazon’s brands from the event
 Amazon’s annual fall event is here, and the company is expected to announce new products from across its many brands — and that’s likely to mean a lot of products. We’d expect to see products from some of Amazon’s own product lines, like the Amazon Echo and Fire TV, and also some from the companies it owns, like Eero, Ring, and Blink.
This annual September event is usually a busy one for Amazon. And in the past, it’s used the event to launch some surprising and quirky things, from a ring drone to an Alexa microwave. So it’s hard to predict exactly what we’ll see.
The Verge will keep you updated on the news coming out of the invite-only event. It’s set to kick off on Wednesday, September 28th, at 9AM PT / 12PM ET, and we’ll have coverage live.]]></summary>

Film of classic children’s book hails from great Irish studio Cartoon Saloon and launches on Nov. 11
 Netflix has revealed the release date and first trailer for My Father’s Dragon, an animated feature based on the classic children’s book. The film, made by the great Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon (Wolfwalkers), will be released on Nov. 11.
My Father’s Dragon is about a young boy called Elmer Elevator. Discomfited by a move to a new city, Elmer befriends a talking alley cat, who tells him about a baby dragon being kept captive on Wild Island. Elmer resolves to rescue the dragon — a plump thing, with blue and yellow candy stripes — and adventures to Wild Island, where he must outwit many cunning animals to reach his goal.
In the surreal 1948 book, written by Ruth Stiles Gannett and indelibly illustrated by her stepmother Ruth Chrisman Gannett, Elmer grows up to be the father of the book’s narrator — hence its title. Judging by the charming trailer, it seems Cartoon Saloon is keeping this conceit going with a voiceover framing device.
The film is directed by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Nora Twomey, who also directed two of studio’s best films — The Secret of Kells and The Breadwinner, both nominated for Oscars, and both featured in our list of the best animated movies of the 2010s. It could not have a better pedigree. The cast includes Jacob Tremblay (Room, Luca) as Elmer and Gaten Matarazzo (Stranger Things) as Boris the Dragon, as well as the likes of Dianne Wiest, Rita Moreno, Chris O’Dowd, Judy Greer, Alan Cumming, Whoopi Goldberg, and Ian McShane.

Cloudflare is testing a new kind of CAPTCHA that tests your browser instead of you. The company calls it Turnstile, and it’s designed to spare us from performing those mundane click-the-traffic-light kinds of tasks to verify you’re a human and not a bot.
Turnstile is being presented as “a user-friendly, privacy preserving alternative” to CAPTCHA. According to a press release, it will get rid of the interactive challenges used to verify people, which Cloudflare says normally take an average of 32 seconds to pass, and reduce the entire process to one second.
An interaction-free test that reduces confirmation time to one second
Instead of presenting a visual puzzle to a user, Turnstile applies one of many browser challenges that it rotates through to look for human …]]></summary>

Amazon has some new products on the way. The company is holding an invite-only, virtual event today, where it’s expected to introduce products from across its lineup of brands. 
Chances are, there’s going to be a lot to see. Amazon is unusually good at keeping its upcoming releases under wraps, and it usually uses its annual September event to announce a lot of new products. Those could come from Amazon’s own product lineup — which includes the Kindle, Fire TV, and Echo — and from some of its acquired brands, like Eero, Ring, and Blink.
The Echo is the big one to keep an eye on. It’s been a while since we saw new updates for the Echo, which last saw a new version of its standard and Dot models in 2020. The Kindle just saw a major update to its entry-level model, but it’s been around three years since the higher-end Oasis was updated. The Fire TV Stick just got an update last year, but it is possible Amazon could have other parts of the Fire TV ecosystem it wants to update.
Then there’s Ring and Eero. Those product lines are a lot harder to predict. But if we do see them, there’s a good chance they’ll continue to build out the product ecosystems they’ve already been working on since they’ve had fairly recent additions to some of their key products.
The event is being livestreamed on an invite-only basis, so it’s not open to the public. The Verge will be covering the event as it happens, giving you updates as they come in through our live blog. The event kicks off at 9AM PT / 12PM ET.

Practical questions for creating community, according to Priya Parker.
 Even when times are normal, figuring out how to host — or attend — a gathering can be fraught. What do you wear? Who will be there? What will happen while you’re there? When will everyone go home?
And now the pandemic has thrown an extra wrench into things. Not just because people have varying levels of comfort and ability to gather; the disruption to our normal life patterns have left some of us feeling drained of our past ability to socialize for days on end. Or we feel like we’ve forgotten the social scripts that governed our interactions. We’re all awkward. 
Yet gathering in some form is essential to our social, mental, and even physical health; humans aren’t meant to exist without…]]></summary>

The publisher is releasing (at least) 9 games in the next 3 months, and I’ve played most of them
 Reeling from pandemic production issues — and, perhaps, a gradual shift toward more sustainable working practices — the video game industry is well into a product drought. After a barren summer, we are facing a meager release schedule through fall and toward the end of the year, with few of the major titles and platform exclusives that usually adorn the season. By all accounts, late 2022 is a quiet time for video games.
But nobody told Square Enix.
The venerable Japanese publisher has a stacked release schedule. Between mid-September and mid-December it is releasing no less than nine games — and as many as 12, if you count the PC version of Triangle Strategy, the L…]]></summary>

Instagram’s test of a new feature that lets you post a text note to your followers appears to be getting a wider rollout, XDA Developers reports. When available, the feature displays in the messages section of the app, below the search bar. “Share what’s on your mind…” the prompt in the text box reads, according to a screenshot posted by XDA. “People won’t be notified when you leave a note. They can see your note for 24 hours and reply with a message.” 
TechCrunch reported in June that the feature was being tested with a limited selection of users, but the fact that XDA has the feature working on multiple devices suggests its availability is expanding. Notes can be up to 60 characters in length, according to TechCrunch.

Wacom has announced the Cintiq Pro 27, its latest pen display for creative professionals such as photo editors and digital artists. It takes on a new look more similar to that of a traditional computer monitor, and features a compact design with slim bezels, 4K resolution, HDR support, and a customizable pen. 
The Cintiq Pro 27 comes in at $3,500 and is available to buy now direct through Wacom or third-party retailers. That price frustratingly doesn’t include a stand, which is required now that Wacom has removed the retractable legs found on older Cintiq models. The official Wacom Cintiq Pro 27 Stand will set you back an additional $500, and is fully adjustable, supporting 20 degrees of display rotation.

Computer chips are ubiquitous, but they’re only made in a few places. 
 In a single day, we interact with hundreds of computer chips, most no larger than a penny. These tiny circuits power everything from smartphones and laptops to medical devices and electric vehicles, and they’re largely responsible for our increasingly computerized lives. But in recent months, the world’s dependence on these chips has also put them at the center of mounting tensions between the United States and mainland China over Taiwan. 
Taiwan is located just 100 miles from China’s eastern coast, and it produces the vast majority of the advanced chips used in today’s electronics. The island is a democracy with its own government, and is home to more than 20 million people. Officials…]]></summary>

Don’t Worry Darling and Barbarian want us to remember gender is scary.
 In most respects, the recent films Don’t Worry Darling and Barbarian could not be more different. 
Darling, directed by Olivia Wilde, is a glossy period piece, set in a 1950s desert town where nothing is quite what it seems. It has opulent production values, plenty of well-known stars, and a premise straight out of a Black Mirror episode. 
Barbarian, directed by Zach Cregger, is a pitch-black horror-comedy, set in a modern-day Detroit that is riddled with maze-like tunnels running underneath the city. For much of its run time, it focuses on just two actors, and its production value…]]></summary>

Tumblr is adding a new filtering feature called “community labels.” Contrary to speculation from some users, Tumblr’s parent company, Automattic, says its broader rules haven’t changed so far — but the feature might lay the groundwork for a more liberal moderation policy.
Community labels, announced yesterday, make the site’s moderation tools more granular. Tumblr is asking users to tag posts that depict or reference three categories of content: drug and alcohol addiction, violence “similar to what you might see in an age-restricted movie,” and “sexual themes” including “erotic writing or imagery.” Adding any of them will add a “mature” label to the post. You can also add a “mature” label for anything you think is sensitive but …]]></summary>

In what could best be described as a very predictable move that’s going to have multiple generations of Marvel fans losing their minds, Hugh Jackman has joined the cast of Marvel Studios’ Deadpool 3 as Wolverine, everyone’s favorite Canadian mutant.
Deadline reports that Jackman will reprise his role as Wolverine for Shawn Levy’s Deadpool 3 — the first time he’s portrayed the character since James Mangold’s Logan in 2017. Jackman’s reprisal is of particular note given how Deadpool 3 will be the franchise’s first film following Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2017, which brought all of the X-Men IP (which includes both Wolverine and Deadpool) back to Marvel Studios. While there was initially some concern as to whether the Deadpool franchise would keep its hard edge after becoming part of the MCU, Kevin Feige’s said that Marvel intends to keep the mutant mercenary in R-rated territory.

Logan, the last movie to feature Wolverine, was similarly darker and more mature than any of Fox’s previous X-Men movies featuring Jackman as the character, and it makes a certain amount of sense that he’ll return on a similar note. Of course, this, certain parts of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Ms. Marvel all beg the question of just what Marvel Studios is planning to do with the rest of the X-Men characters who’ve yet to pop up in the MCU. But with Marvel’s current phase of films drawing near its end, it feels safe to assume that folks with x-factors are a big part of the studio’s plays for the near future.

It’s actually hilarious 
 Say what you will of the multi-franchise monster that Fortnite has become, but at least its developers know how to crack a solid joke. 
Fortnite’s newest skin references the phrase “dead game,” which is a long-running diss-turned-joke in video game communities online. The skin comes as part of a new aesthetic items pack called the “Checkered Past Pack.” The pack has multiple items, one which is the skin which wears black nail polish, a checkered hat, and a sleeveless black turtleneck with the phrase “Dead game,” printed in white lettering on the top.

— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) September 27, 2022



The phrase references a long-running meme used by people to dismiss a game or claim it’s no longer relevant. Basically the phrase is used to imply that a game has fallen off and is no longer played and liked by people any more. (A phrase that has for many a moon, been used to describe Fortnite despite not actual evidence to support it.) Because it’s so commonly misapplied to games that maintain active playerbases, it’s often used as a sarcastic retort to players who might think interest in a specific game is waning.
It’s a playful way for the developers to wink back at potential haters. If you think the skin is cute well you’re in luck. At time of publication, the full pack is available to purchase in Fortnite’s item shop and is available for purchase for $3.99 or 600 V-Bucks.]]></summary>

But over the last few days, fan pages have been buzzing with rumors that one of the guys was also trying infidelity. 
Fans on the Try Guys subreddit began to notice that Ned Fulmer, one of four members of the YouTube group, was missing from recent videos and other content. Speculation swirled, and fans exchanged theories of what was happening, including that Fulmer was being hastily edited out of content.

Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you
 With a couple of exceptions, the word that best summarizes 2022’s big phone launches is “iterative.” This year has been all about small incremental updates that make for more polished devices but don’t offer a lot of incentive to upgrade. If you bought a flagship phone within the past couple of years and you’re happy with how it’s performing, then you’re probably safe to hold off for another year. But if it’s time for a new one, you’ll find that today’s crop of top-tier devices is just a little bit better: more mature, with some minor rough edges smoothed out. 
One thing that hasn’t changed about this year’s flagship class? The high prices. For the most part, they ha…]]></summary>

The device starts at $999 and will be available from Asus and Amazon. Ship dates are yet to be announced. That pricing puts it below many of the best-known 17-inchers in the consumer space today. The Dell XPS 17 and LG Gram 17, two of the best-known products in this category, currently start at $1,849 and $1,199, respectively.

 Deadpool is officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Deadpool 3, which got a teaser video on Tuesday.

But Reynolds reveals that Deadpool 3 is on the way, and more importantly that Hugh Jackman will be reprising his role as Wolverine for the film. The film even got a release date: Sept. 6, 2024.
In the clip, Reynolds explains that they’ve been working on the film for a long time now, but that they’re fresh out of ideas on how to revive the mercenary for the MCU. But they do have one trick up their sleeve, Reynolds says, and that’s when Hugh Jackman walks by…]]></summary>

What’s more romantic than calling your beau a mooncake?
 Shipping is fun, and League of Legends offers a veritable armada of potential ships to sail. The roster has over 160 champions, some of whom are canonically together, while others have plenty of in-universe justification for ships. Then, there’s the just-for-fun ships, the combinations of champions that haven’t happened to meet yet and may never meet. But once in a while, these long-shot ships pay off, and fans get to enjoy a feast of vindication.
Take Sett and Aphelios. Sett is a yakuza-style criminal who runs an Ionian fighting ring, and Aphelios is a silent moon assassin from Mount Targon who channels the spiritual power of his twin sister Alune to summon mystical weapons and slay sun warriors. Despite b…]]></summary>

Why Ned Fulmer is out of the popular YouTube group
 On Tuesday, popular YouTube group The Try Guys announced they have parted with co-creator and executive producer Ned Fulmer. The group shared the announcement on social media platforms, including Twitter and Instagram, and it caps off a day of intense internet sleuthing, speculation, and conspiracy from fans.
“Ned Fulmer is no longer working with The Try Guys,” the statement reads. “As a result of a thorough internal review, we do not see a path forward together. We thank you for your support as we navigate this change.” 
The group’s Twitter bio has already been updated to remove Fulmer’s handle, and their social media avatars across the brand’s pages have been change…]]></summary>

A dataminer claimed to find the files with Mark Hamill’s voice
 Mark Hamill could be the voice of the Joker in Warner Bros.’ fighting game, MultiVersus, a new datamine revealed on Tuesday. The actor, who is perhaps most known for playing Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars series is also one of the most recognizable voices of Joker. The actor first played Batman’s iconic nemesis in Batman: The Animated Series, and now it’s looking like he’ll reprise his role in the game.
The Joker was previously rumored to be a fighter in the game thanks to a March datamine. The new audio containing the Joker’s lines was posted on Twitter by user Laisul. In the video, you can hear all of Joker’s match announcement lines, in a voice that sounds quite a bit like Hamill’s. 
Polygon reached out to a representative of the development team to confirm the leak, and will update this story as we hear back. 
Hamill has reprised his role as The Clown Prince of Crime several times since his first appearance in the 1992 animate series, including in games like the Batman: Arkham series and Lego DC Super-Villains.
MultiVersus is a free-to-play competitive fighting game series that features a cast of fighters from various Warner Bros. properties and series. Most recently, the developers added Rick Sanchez from the adult animation series Rick and Morty to the game.]]></summary>

Netflix is officially introducing gamertag-style handles subscribers can use in its mobile games. The company first began rolling out handles that will be shown in multiplayer games and on online leaderboards in some games last month, but in a blog post published Tuesday, Netflix said that users can now set them up on both iOS and Android devices.
The process of actually making your handle differs depending on which operating system you use. On Android, in the games tab in Netflix’s navigation bar, you can tap the banner that says “Create your Netflix game handle” to get started. The iOS version of the Netflix app doesn’t have a dedicated games tab, so you’ll need to download a game like Riv…]]></summary>

How a few election law fixes could protect democracy in 2024. 
 The human mind is ingenious. It can create towering works of art and make remarkable scientific discoveries. It is, as we saw in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, also capable of inventing new ways to undermine American democracy by abusing our existing election laws, and turning orderly presidential elections into anarchy and chaos. 
It’s beyond the ken of lawmakers, or perhaps anyone, to try to sniff out every potential avenue for havoc. But they can fix obvious defects in presidential elections once they have been exploited. 
The Electoral Count Reform Act currently before the Senate is an effort to do that, fitting into a long history of legislative action following a break…]]></summary>

 Overwatch 2 players who are brand-new to the franchise — meaning those who never played the original Overwatch — will need to spend considerable time with the sequel to unlock the game’s existing roster of 32 heroes.

 Thrash-and-blast rhythm shooter Metal: Hellsinger has a pretty simple hook: It’s extremely fun to pump demons full of lead in time with your favorite hard-rocking artists absolutely shredding on guitar. However, those with different musical sensibilities might not necessarily get that. That’s okay, because Metal: Hellsinger developer The Outsiders have released modding tools that allow savvy players to add basically whatever music they want.
Like, for example, jazz.
We have Metal: Hellsinger. Now meet Jazz: Hellsinger.  
Unleash Hell to YOUR beat. Custom music modding is now available on PC!

— Metal: Hellsinger     OUT NOW! (@MetalHellsinger) September 27, 2022



Per the game’s official website, players who have Metal: Hellsinger or its demo on PC can mod the game to work with any kind of music: K-Pop, EDM, hip-hop, or Kidz Bop. Given the nature of copyright enforcement, actually showing off those mods publicly might be tricky, but that just means folks will have to get even more creative. Imagine playing Metal: Hellsinger to the sultry tones of WTF with Marc Maron, or the outrageous stories on Normal Gossip. You already listen to podcasts while gaming, why not combine the two?]]></summary>

Samsung Display and Intel are working on “slidable” PCs. During Intel’s Innovation keynote today, Samsung Display CEO JS Choi appeared onstage to show off a prototype PC that slides from a 13-inch tablet into a 17-inch display.
“We’re announcing the world’s first 17-inch slidable display for PCs,” said Choi. “This device will satisfy various needs for a larger screen and portability as well.” Samsung Display has chosen to implement a sliding (rather than foldable) technology for its flexible PC displays, and Choi appeared to indicate that “foldable is gone” on PCs for now.

      Samsung Display’s concept PC slides into place.
  
Intel has been experimenting with new PC form factors for years and was initially preparing for a dual-screen and foldable future before Microsoft dropped its plans for Windows 10X on foldables. These types of new form factors desperately need the software and apps to make them shine, and it’s not clear yet how Intel will make slidable PCs a reality.
The prototype device that Samsung Display and Intel have shown off today essentially turns a 13-inch tablet into a 17-inch monitor with a flexible display and a sliding mechanism. Intel was quick to demonstrate its new Unison software on this display, which aims to connect Intel-powered computers to smartphones — including iPhones.
The slidable PC itself is just a concept for now, and there’s no word from Intel or Samsung Display on when it will become a reality.]]></summary>

Terraria, Stardew Valley, Factorio, and more
 Base-building and management simulator games scratch a particular itch. There’s that perfect gameplay loop that comes from doing menial tasks and then, later, building systems to help automate those chores. But these games are often more fun with others, letting you create abominations together or ruthlessly mess with each other’s work. 
So we’ve created a list of some of our favorites that support cooperative play; mostly online multiplayer with a few entries that support couch co-op. This list broadly covers base-building, automation, survival, and certain types of crafting games. What they share in common is a particular game loop, with resource gathering and crafting complementary to other goals — f…]]></summary>

Valve is making a change to its schedule of big Steam sales. Starting in 2023, the company will be replacing the Lunar New Year sale, which it has run since 2016, with an annual spring sale, the company announced on Tuesday. The first version of this spring sale will take place from March 16th to March 23rd.
“The addition of a Spring Sale was a popular request from our developer and publisher community,” Valve says in a blog post about the news. “It will allow us to create more space between our four major seasonal sales and provide more opportunities throughout the year for developers to expand and execute their discounting calendar.” 
Now there’s a big Steam sale for every season
As for why it is discontinuing the Lunar New Year sale, which typically took place in late January or early February, Valve said it received feedback that the sale was too close to the “December holiday sale period.” That said, Valve expects that some publishers will still discount their games around the Lunar New Year in the future.
With this new spring sale, there will now be a major Steam sale for each season, and Valve has already shared the dates for its upcoming autumn and winter sales. The autumn sale will take place from November 22nd to November 29th, while the winter sale will happen from December 22nd to January 5th.]]></summary>

We’ll also see Utkarsh Ambudkar (Ghosts) as the Earth Kingdom’s ruler Bumi, Amber Midthunder (Prey) as the Northern Water Tribe’s Princess Yue, and Danny Pudi (Mythic Quest) as the Mechanist.
Even Star Trek’s George Takei gets a role in the show as the unsettling spirit, Koh. Netflix also confirmed that James Sie (Stillwater), the voice actor behind the perpetua…]]></summary>

Intel is officially announcing pricing for its top Arc graphics card today. The top-of-the-line Arc A770 will arrive on October 12th, starting at $329. This price matches that of Nvidia’s RTX 3060, a card that the A770 is expected to comfortably outperform.
“We’ve been seeing that for a long time the price of GPUs is right in this $200–$300 range, but what’s happened in the last few years is that they’ve gotten super expensive,” says Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger. “You should be frustrated because you are losing out as the gaming community, and today we’re fixing that.”
The A770 will include up to 16GB of GDDR6 memory, a 2100MHz clock, and 32 Xe cores. Intel hasn’t released full benchmarks for the A770 yet, but it shared some …]]></summary>

 2021 was a banner year for anime, featuring the long-awaited return of regular favorites such as Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure, and My Hero Academia alongside exciting new original anime like Odd Taxi, The Heike Story, Sonny Boy, and SK8 the Infinity. 2022 is shaping up to be much of the same, with popular series such as Mob Psycho 100 and Bleach slated to make their return later this year. And all signs point to the highly anticipated debuts of Chainsaw Man and Uzumaki!
There’s a wealth to choose from and not nearly enough time in the day to watch it all, which is why we’ll be updating our list of the best anime airing in 2022 throughout the year as the seasons progress. Ta…]]></summary>

Four seasons of savings
 Great news for those who, like myself, love to buy video games at astonishingly low prices without nary a thought about whether or not there is enough time to play them: Valve has announced the dates for its next batch of seasonal Steam sales. 
The dates are as follows:
Autumn Sale: Nov. 22 - 29
Winter Sale: Dec. 22 - Jan. 5
Spring Sale: March 16 - 23
The spring sale will be new in 2023. According to Valve, the sale will replace the Lunar New Year sale on its calendar, and was added in order to make its seasonal sales more evenly spaced out.


If this is your first rodeo — and if you are the lucky owner of a new Steam Deck, it might be — Steam’s big seasonal sales are something of an event, with a little bit more to them than just steep markdowns. There’s usually some kind of gimmick that sends customers on scavenger hunts in the hopes that they will buy more in exchange for digital goodies. But also the games are hella cheap, which makes every sale an opportunity to play my favorite game: Role-playing someone with all the time in the world to finish every game I buy.]]></summary>

Google is updating its Play Store to make it easier to discover and download apps across the full range of Android devices — whether that’s Wear OS watches, Android TVs, Android tablets, or vehicles fitted with Android Auto. There are three updates in total: a new device-specific search filter, new sections in the Android app focused on devices that aren’t phones, and new options to remotely install apps from your phone. 
These updates come as Google is working to improve the Android hardware ecosystem beyond phones — a focus highlighted by the company’s own efforts to release more Android hardware options, including a Google Pixel smartwatch this year and a new Google tablet in 2023. It seems that if Google itself is offering a broader rang…]]></summary>

The 2023 Nissan Ariya will start at $44,485 when it goes on sale in the late fall, the automaker announced. That’s about $3,000 cheaper than the starting price announced by Nissan almost a year ago. 
The base model Ariya, which will have front-wheel drive and a 63 kWh battery pack, will start at $43,190. With a $1,295 destination charge, that price increases to $44,485. 
The Ariya, which was first announced in summer 2020, was expected to go on sale in Japan in the middle of 2021, followed by the US and Canada later in the year. But that’s been delayed, with North American customers not expected to receive deliveries until later this year.

The words “Nintendo” and “online” usually can’t be uttered in the same sentence without a few chuckles and murmurs. But I’m legitimately impressed with the latest update to its Nintendo Switch Online app for iOS and Android. Paid subscribers can now add Splatoon 3-specific widgets to their phone or tablet homescreen. 
Version 2.3.0 of the app for either platform adds the ability to use three new widgets: a photo album to see the pictures that you’ve snapped from the game, your battle log to show your recent wins and losses, and finally — my favorite — a stage schedule that fills you in on the upcoming stage rotation for various game modes. That one also shows what gear you have equipped and what abilities that gear has.
If you can’t get enough Splatoon 3 (I represented Team Gear, winner of the most recent Splatfest — just sayin’), using these widgets is a good way to constantly be tapped into your obsession. Each of the widgets is a different size (and can be modified slightly), so organize your homescreen accordingly.
Here’s how the new widgets look on my Android phone homescreen.
  
It’s ironic and kind of great that Splatoon 3 brought about this forward-thinking online integration out of Nintendo. Compared to previous installments, this game’s online modes are much easier to join and play with friends, and this update is further evidence that Nintendo is more serious than ever before about online. Though, I still haven’t forgotten about that convoluted voice chat solution it devised for Splatoon 2.]]></summary>

Netflix has released the official trailer for The Playlist, its upcoming show about the creation of Spotify, and the nearly two-minute trailer indicates the show will be a very serious look at how the streaming giant built its empire. If you’re a fan of high-stakes business dramas, this one seems as though it will check a lot of the boxes; the trailer has glimpses of dramatic boardroom scenes, swanky parties, and even congressional testimony.
That said, if you’re looking for a completely accurate story about the rise of Spotify, this isn’t going to be it. While the trailer says this series is based on “6 untold stories,” Netflix spells out that the show is a “fictionalized account.” I’m guessing that means the creators will be playing a bit fast and loose with the historical facts in service of making something fit for a television series. To be clear, I think that’s a totally fine thing to do! Just don’t expect this to be a documentary. The series is inspired by Spotify Untold, a book about Spotify by two Swedish business reporters, according to Variety.
The Playlist, which will be a six-episode series, debuts on Netflix on October 13th. If you want another peek at what you can expect from the show, check out the teaser trailer from earlier this month.]]></summary>

Intel has announced an intriguing new app called Unison, which aims to “seamlessly” connect Intel-powered computers to smartphones — not just Android phones but iOS devices as well. 
Following what Intel says is a “simple pairing process,” the Unison app will allow PCs to replicate four key features of the connected phone. They can answer and make calls; they can share photos and files (pictures taken with the phone will show up in a specific Unison gallery on the PC); they can send and receive texts; and they can receive (and, in some cases, respond to) notifications that the phone receives — though if Unison is closed, they’ll go to the Windows notification center.

After weeks of teasers and leaks, Intel is finally making its 13th Gen processors official today. Intel’s 13th Gen desktop CPUs will start arriving on October 20th, led by the flagship Core i9-13900K priced at $589. That’s the same price as Intel’s previous 12900K flagship, despite Intel’s warning of price increases. Intel’s 13th Gen announcement comes just as AMD launches its new Ryzen 7000 processors today in a battle for desktop dominance.
Intel’s Core i9-13900K will ship with 24 cores, 32 threads, and clock speeds of up to 5.8GHz. Built on Intel’s 7 process and its x86 performance hybrid architecture, 13th Gen processors include Performance cores (P-cores) and Efficient cores (E-cores) that split workloads intelligently using Intel’s …]]></summary>

Alienware has introduced a slightly cheaper version of its 34-inch QD-OLED curved gaming monitor, scheduling it to launch in China first on October 18th, followed by the US and Canada on November 8th, 2022. While similar in many ways to the $1,299.99 AW3423DW it delivered in the spring, there are two key spots where Alienware made changes that help get the sticker price of this AW3423DWF down to $1,099.99 (note: this isn’t replacing the AW3423DW; both models will be sold simultaneously). Namely, it dropped Nvidia’s G-Sync Ultimate variable refresh rate (VRR) support in favor of AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and it lowered the refresh rate from 175Hz to 165Hz.

Samsung’s third One UI 5.0 beta arrived late last week, and users have started noticing that the lock screen customization options look pretty darn similar to those introduced by Apple in iOS 16 earlier this month (via 9to5Mac). While Samsung has been letting users customize their lock screens for years now, whether through its Good Lock app or its One UI system, its most recent update seems to take a lot of inspiration from Apple (although inspiration can flow in both directions).
Lock screen customization is one of the biggest changes in iOS 16, as Apple introduced widgets, new wallpaper options, and the ability to tweak everything from font type, colors, wallpaper filters, and more. The latest version of the beta gives Samsung users more con…]]></summary>

Nvidia is releasing an important driver update today for those on the latest Windows 11 2022 Update. The new Game Ready 517.48 driver fixes an issue with the GeForce Experience overlay causing stuttering and frame rate drops with Microsoft’s latest Windows 11 2022 Update.
Many Nvidia users had reported the issues last week, and Nvidia quickly issued a beta fix ahead of this new driver today. Alongside the big fixes for Windows 11, this new driver also includes additional Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) support for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

      Nvidia’s latest driver introduces full DLSS 2 support in Microsoft Flight Simulator.
  
“Developer Asobo Studio has just launched Sim Update 10, with the integration of NVIDIA DLSS 2,” explains Nvidia’s Andrew Burnes. “To take full advantage of this technology, our new Game Ready Driver is a required update.”
This latest driver is also optimized for Overwatch 2, which arrives as a free-to-play title on October 4th. Nvidia’s latency-reducing Reflex technology will also be supported in Overwatch 2. Four more G-Sync compatible displays are also supported in this new driver, including Sony’s new Inzone gaming monitors.

And they’re even more fun in the movie
 Bullet Train was one of this summer’s non-franchise delights, a violent action-comedy best described as John Wick by way of Looney Tunes. With its theatrical run now firmly behind it, the cinematic pain train from the director of Deadpool 2 is about to arrive at its next stop: video on-demand. 
A madcap action movie about a semi-retired assassin named Ladybug (Brad Pitt) trying his best to get a suitcase off a train full of other assassins who want the same thing, Bullet Train is the kind of movie one imagines was as fun to make as the comedy on screen. A behind-the-scenes look at the film, which arrives with the home video release, confirms as such. As a little teaser, Polygon can exclusively share a brief blooper reel, which mostly features two of the movies best characters, the duo Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), pal-ing around when they should be doing stuff like hurting people.
Bullet Train is now available on VOD, and arrives on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD on October 18.]]></summary>

Nexon-backed Embark Studios shows its first game, a Running Man-style game show
 Four years ago, Electronic Arts’ chief design officer left to co-found his own studio, created with Nexon’s backing. On Monday, Patrick Söderlund’s studio showed off its first game: The Finals, a squad-based, free-to-play multiplayer shooter inspired by sci-fi bloodsport narratives like Squid Game and The Running Man, where pretty much everything on the game’s maps can be destroyed.
The Finals, said Embark Studios creative director Gustav Tilleby, is “a hero builder, not a hero shooter.” As shown in a debut trailer, players will have access to a variety of weapons and their tactical uses, from a katana and other melee weapons, to rocket launchers, and even a foam gun that can rei…]]></summary>

Meta says it has disrupted a sophisticated Russian influence operation that operated across its own social platforms, Facebook and Instagram, as well as Twitter, YouTube, Telegram, and even LiveJournal.
In a new report on removing coordinated inauthentic behavior, Meta says that the influence campaign originated in Russia and involved a “sprawling” network of more than 60 fake websites. In a bid for borrowed credibility, some of those sites impersonated mainstream European news outlets like Der Spiegel, The Guardian and Bild.
Social media accounts within the network shared spoofed articles from these news outlets, mostly criticizing Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees or arguing against sanctions placed on Russia. Content in the spoofed articles …]]></summary>

 Polygon is on the ground at the 2022 Fantastic Fest, reporting on new horror, sci-fi, cult, and action movies making their way to theaters and streaming. This review was published in conjunction with the film’s Fantastic Fest premiere.
2021’s movie scene of the year — the one that dominated critic and cinephile talk during awards season — came from Michael Sarnoski’s Pig, a deliriously violent but quiet thriller about Nicolas Cage’s ex-chef chasing down his stolen truffle pig. At one point, Cage’s character, Rob, a retired chef turned backwoods recluse, sits down in a ritzy haute cuisine restaurant and summons the chef, a former employee of his.

The 1,250-pound DART spacecraft hit the asteroid at approximately 14,760 mph — in the days to come, NASA scientists will pore over data to figure out how much Dimorphos’s momentum was changed by the collision, with initial estimates projecting that it moved 1 percent closer to …]]></summary>

The sci-fi franchise is all TV these days, and there’s something for (almost) everyone
 Here’s a wild statistic: There are nearly as many currently running Star Trek television series as there are completed Star Trek television series. The first 40 years of the franchise’s history include five live-action series and one animated spinoff, totaling 725 episodes. In the past five years, five new series have launched (six if you count Short Treks as its own entity), airing a cumulative 130 episodes as of today. Star Trek as a brand is busier than it’s been since the mid-1990s, when Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and the Next Generation TV series were all running concurrently and shops around the world dedicated entire displays to Star Trek toys, novels…]]></summary>

Rick Sanchez also joins the game’s roster
 MultiVersus has a new update that’s set to bring a few changes to the game. Beta patch 1.03 adds Rick Sanchez to the game as its newest fighter, makes a few balance tweaks, and most importantly significantly increases the amount of experience players need to hit level 15 with every character. 
According to the patch notes from developer Player First Games, the XP requirements for progressing from level 3 to level 15 have been doubled. The developer says that it’s making the change because it felt that players were progressing through the levels too quickly, and it wanted to “make it a bit more of a journey.” 
The only problem is, despite increasing the time it takes to earn these levels, Player First Games didn’t increase the rewards that players get for progressing. So it’s more work for the exact same reward. 
Other than this slightly frustrating adjustment, the patch also brings in the game’s latest character with Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty, and a new anti-infinite combo system that should help prevent players from getting caught in enemy combos that chain the same move together too many times in a row. 
MultiVersus patch 1.03 will arrive after the game’s maintenance, which should end around 1 p.m. ET. For a look at all of the changes in the latest MultiVersus patch you can check out the full patch notes.]]></summary>

If you’ve been intrigued by the high-tech Freewrite typewriter but put off by its price tag, manufacturer Astrohaus’ new design is (maybe) for you. Astrohaus is opening preorders for the Freewrite Alpha, a lower-profile version of its first-generation device. Like the original Freewrite, it’s billed as a distraction-free writing tool that syncs wirelessly with services like Google Drive or Dropbox but for $349 (or $249 for early orders) instead of the original Freewrite’s $649 price tag. An Indiegogo campaign launches today with a shipping date of July 2023.

A classic trope, done two ways
 Perhaps you have noticed that two of the biggest television shows airing (or streaming) right now are both fantasy epics based on popular novels exploring the time period before a popular previous adaptation. While it would be reductive to call HBO’s House of the Dragon and Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power the same kind of show — they extremely are not — occasionally, in ways big and small, they do some of the same things. Like last weekend, when the latest episodes of each show both engaged in the classic trope of having an experienced sword fighter school some young whippersnappers in the best way to study the blade.

British satellite broadcaster Sky is launching a Sky Stream puck next month that will let people access TV content over Wi-Fi instead of a satellite dish. While Sky launched its Glass platform in the UK last year, you had to buy a whole new TV to get access to Sky TV over the internet. Sky Stream launches on October 18th, and it means you can connect a puck to any TV and get Sky TV content over Wi-Fi or ethernet.
The Sky Stream device will plug into a pocket socket and a TV’s HDMI input, and it only requires a minimum speed of 10Mbps broadband. It’s capable of streaming HD as standard, but you can also add 4K and HDR streaming add-ons. It’s the latest move in Sky’s ambitious effort to move away from the satellite dishes that have defined its TV service for decades. 
Image: Sky
      A Sky Stream device in a living room.
  
Pricing will start at £29 per month for a 31-day rolling contract that can be canceled at any time or £26 per month for an 18-month plan. The puck itself is essentially £39.95, as you’re paying a “setup fee,” or it’s £20 if you take out an 18-month contract. The basic package will provide access to Sky’s base offering of TV channels, and there are add-ons like Sky Cinema, Sky Sports, BT Sports, and 4K support that cost extra. You can also pick a whole home pack upgrade that lets you add up to five extra Sky Stream devices for £12 per month. 
Sky Stream will include the ability to restart live TV, but you won’t get the recording options found on Sky Q boxes that come with hard drive storage. Given so much content is available on demand in the UK now, that might not be a problem for most people seeking an alternative to satellite dish installation.]]></summary>

Whether you’re working from a noisy cafe or commuting on a train, a comfortable pair of noise-canceling headphones can prove invaluable in the right setting. Thankfully, Bose’s QuietComfort 45 are currently matching their best price to date at Best Buy, where you can pick them up for $249 instead of $329 — a discount we haven’t seen in a while.
The lightweight QC45 are some of the most comfortable over-ears we’ve ever tested and can even last 24 hours on a single charge. That means you can don them for hours on end without worrying about running out of battery or ear fatigue. And when you do need to recharge them, you can do so quickly thanks to their s…]]></summary>

WhatsApp has published details of a “critical” vulnerability that has been patched in a newer version of the app but could still affect older installations that have not been updated.
Details were disclosed in a September update of WhatsApp’s page on security advisories affecting the app and came to light on September 23rd.
The critical bug would allow an attacker to exploit a code error known as an integer overflow, letting them execute their own code on a victim’s smartphone after sending a specially crafted video call. Remote code execution vulnerabilities are a key step in installing malware, spyware, or other malicious applications on a target system, as they give attackers a foot in the door that can be used to further compromise the m…]]></summary>

You’d be forgiven for forgetting, or just not knowing, that Skullcandy once had some skin in the game of putting out gaming headsets. The company owned Astro Gaming throughout most of the 2010s, which it later sold to Logitech in 2017. It’s been relatively quiet on the gaming front since then, but Skullcandy’s now back with a new lineup of headsets. There are three, ranging in price and functionality — each accented with a slightly different-looking printer color test page pattern on their sidearms (my interpretation, not Skullcandy’s). There’s the $59.99 wired SLYR, the $99.99 wired but more feature-packed SLYR Pro, and finally, the $129.99 PLYR wireless headset, pict…]]></summary>

Families are now grappling with inflation and a shortage of day care staff.
 On the Senate floor in early August, just two days before lawmakers voted to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, four senior Democrats came out to lament what they believed to be the bill’s biggest omission: child care.  
“We cannot simply vote on this package and call it a day,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) said. “Our child care system isn’t just stretched thin; it is broken.”
Less than two months later, the extent of that brokenness is clearer than ever. Public schools are fully reopened, and most pandemic-era restrictions are relaxed. But working conditions for families with kids who need child care are not back to normal. For both workers and parents, already-grim trends in child care ha…]]></summary>

The company is expanding Project Genesis’ coverage, but there are still basic features missing that make it clear the service isn’t for the general public.
 As soon as I got in my car, my Galaxy S22 connected to Dish’s brand new 5G network lost connection to the internet. I was a little surprised but not shocked — the service, Project Genesis, is only a few months old and only covers around a quarter of the US population. The service has always been a bit spotty on my side of Spokane, Washington, growing stronger and more reliable as you get closer to downtown. But as I drove laps around Riverside park, which was once my go-to testing area for the service, I grew increasingly confused — my phone no longer seemed to be connecting to any …]]></summary>

Sackett v. EPA may prove to be the most significant attack on America’s clean water laws since the 1970s.
 For decades, the Supreme Court struggled to define a key term at the heart of the Clean Water Act, the landmark 1972 legislation that forms the backbone of America’s efforts to “restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation’s waters.” 
It’s an admittedly difficult question, that is now in the hands of the most conservative Supreme Court since the 1930s. And the Court’s Republican-appointed supermajority seems poised to deal a severe blow to the clean water law, in a case that co…]]></summary>

Taking to social media, she penned an emotional retirement post expressing her gratitude towards everyone who was a part of her journey. "To my cricket family and beyond.

There is a sense of pride every time I hear the National Anthem before a match," she wrote. Here, we bring you pictures from Goswami's final match.]]></summary>

As Sony’s PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Digital Edition approach their second birthday, it seems that supplies of both next-gen consoles are finally catching up with demand (even with a new model reportedly on the way).

Monday’s The Last of Us teaser trailer also served as a casting announcement for Yellowjackets star Melanie Lynskey in the HBO series.

Populations are growing in coastal cities, which are vulnerable as sea levels rise and hurricanes drive larger storm surges.
 Hurricane Ian is barreling toward the Florida coast and is expected to reach Category 3 strength by Monday night, with winds reaching upward of 129 mph. Mandatory evacuations have already begun. 
But wind and rain alone aren’t what’s making Ian a threat; Florida’s population has been growing in recent years, with some of the largest increases in vulnerable coastal cities like Tampa and Miami. Forecasters are getting better at predicting hurricanes. However, these storms are capturing more people and property in their swaths of destruction…]]></summary>

The Richard Garfield-designed CCG hasn’t produced a new deck in years
 The story of KeyForge is a strange one. The collectible card game arrived with much fanfare in 2018 (including from us), boasting a procedural algorithm capable of generating some 32 billion different decks of cards all on its own. The allure was its surprise factor, since not even the game’s developers knew what was inside each box. Publisher Fantasy Flight Games quickly got a foothold in hobby stores and established a nascent organized play circuit; the game felt like it was poised to become the next big CCG. Then, in September 2021, the publisher announced it was no longer able to produce any more cards.
The messaging at the time was cryptic. Fantasy Flight simply said tha…]]></summary>

Still on the hunt for a next-gen PlayStation 5? Right now, Sony is selling the disc-based PlayStation 5 with a digital copy of Guerrilla Games’ excellent Horizon Forbidden West for $549.99, which is $10 less than the cost if you were to buy the two individually. The best part? You don’t even have to wait in line in order to pick one up.
While we’ve been seeing Sony and other retailers offer stock for longer than usual recently, speed is still the name of the game here. We can’t suggest any hacks that will guarantee you’ll land the console today, but as detailed in our guide on how to buy a PS5, there are a few things you can do to improve your chance of securing one. For one, remember that you must log in with your PlayStation Network ID to buy a PlayStation 5 from Sony, so make sure you have your username and password ready. Also, be aware that you can only buy one console per account, so don’t waste time trying to buy more than one.




If you don’t manage to land a console today, be sure to check back in with us. Restock events such as this are not as rare as they once were, and we routinely call out stock whenever we see it at Amazon, Target, Best Buy, and other retailers.

In the meantime, it could be wise to start preparing for your new PS5 with some fun accessories and games. Here are a few we recommend:]]></summary>

Do Kwon, a co-founder of Terraform Labs, has insisted that he’s not on the run after the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin, but Interpol is apparently under the impression he’s a fugitive. According to South Korean publication Yonhap and The New York Times, South Korean prosecutors said that Interpol has issued a “red notice” asking for help from worldwide law enforcement to find and arrest Kwon.
Interpol:
Red Notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.

Earlier this month, South Korea issued a warrant for the arrest of Kwon and five other individuals, and prosecutors believed they were all in Singapore as recently as September 14th. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office had asked Interpol to issue the red notice, saying that Kwon was “obviously on the run and has no intention to appear before us for questioning,” the Financial Times reported last Monday.
Kwon has publicly maintained that he isn’t trying to escape. On September 17th, Kwon tweeted that “I am not ‘on the run’ or anything similar.” Earlier this afternoon, after not tweeting for more than a week, he appeared on Twitter again, saying that he is “making zero effort to hide.” Given Interpol’s red notice, perhaps Kwon is trickier to find than he might be letting on.
Interpol’s press office said the organization does not comment on specific cases or individuals and that the “majority” of red notices aren’t made public. You can see which notices are public on Interpol’s website. Terraform Labs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hint: Water scarcity in the Western US has more to do with our diets than our lawns. 
 The Western United States is currently battling the most severe drought in thousands of years. A mix of bad water management policies and manmade climate change has created a situation where water supplies in Western reservoirs are so low, states are being forced to cut their water use. 
It’s not hard to find media coverage that focuses on the excesses of residential water use: long showers, swimming pools, lawn watering, at-home car washes. Or in the business sector, like irrigating golf courses or pumping water into hotel fountains in Las Vegas. 
But when a team of researchers looked at water use in the West, they uncovered a very different story about where most Western water goes. Only 14 percent of all water consumption in the Western US goes to residential, commercial, and industrial water use. So who’s really using up the water? Their findings may hold the solution to dwindling water supplies in the West.

But it was close
 The heroes of Marvel Comics are currently having some trouble with being harshly judged by an unstoppable space-god. And this week saw another long-anticipated development in the blockbuster event series AXE: Judgment Day. 
In May, Marvel Comics published its retailer solicitations for the month, including a brief description of Avengers #60, which stated: “Hawkeye must prove that he brings at least as much joy and usefulness to the world as a randomly chosen mailbox.” 
In regard to which I had only one thing to say: “God, I hope that’s meant literally.” Now, we finally know the answer.
What else is happening in the pages of our favorite comics? We’ll tell you. Welcome to Monday Funnies, Polygon’s weekly …]]></summary>

There’s one last place in my life where the alerts, texts, pings, and emails, emails, emails! can’t find me: the shower. It is a sacred space where I process information, brainstorm, and sometimes, as a treat, anxiety-spiral over something dumb I said 15 years ago. But it has come to my attention that some of you are violating the sanctity of Shower Thought Time by actually inviting your phones into the shower. When this came to my attention, I did some digging and discovered dozens — dozens! — of waterproof phone mounts designed for the shower. Truly, I am shocked. You guys are bringing your phones into the shower?

The right-to-repair enthusiasts at iFixit have published a video providing a screw-by-screw breakdown of the Apple Watch Ultra. The entire video serves less as a review of the capabilities of the Ultra and more of an intimate examination of the tech and engineering that goes into Apple’s powerful timepiece. 
iFixit’s breakdown exposed some vulnerabilities in the Apple Watch Ultra, not only in terms of its repairability but also its durability. The raised lip of the Ultra, which is intended to protect the screen, only really works against side-on impacts. As the video points out, any kind of head-on collision with the screen still risks a screen replacement. Getting to the battery on the Ultra r…]]></summary>

The game takes a novel approach to turn order
 In a role-playing game, initiative — that is, the order in which players and enemies take their turns — is one of the biggest factors in setting the tone, and the stakes, for combat. Traditionally, initiative order takes the form of a list that moves from top to bottom, activating player characters and enemies along the way, then resetting at the “top of the order” on the next turn.
But traditional initiative order can be a little boring. That’s especially true for a subset of RPGs known as dungeon-crawler board games. Like Diablo, this action-oriented genre of games, including titles like Gloomhaven and Descent: Legends of the Dark, empowers players to move quickly from fight to fight.

The news that Twitch will be reducing top streamers’ revenue share from 70 / 30 to 50 / 50 signals that the platform is no longer the ‘creator first’ entity that made it so popular.
 The reaction to the news that Twitch intends to change how it splits revenue with partnered streamers has been, on the whole, completely and utterly negative. Streamers at every level of growth, from the big-time partners to the smallest affiliates, were displeased to learn that the 70 / 30 revenue sharing split that had been long asked for — and is the standard or better elsewhere — was not only being rejected but being slowly phased out completely. To quote the Fallout 4 meme: “everyone disliked that.”

Meta is testing a new way to add and switch between your accounts on Instagram and Facebook by integrating its Accounts Center into the apps. The features should help make things easier for anyone who constantly bounces between various accounts on the two apps or people who have a lot of Instagram profiles to separate their Online Brand, personal life, and business.
The new account switcher for Facebook and Instagram will show you all the accounts and profiles you’ve added to the Accounts Center. While Instagram has let you switch between different profiles for years, the new system lets you throw Facebook accounts in the mix, making it easier to jump over to Facebook if you need to do something on that app. It’ll also show you some details about notifications for each…]]></summary>

I was one of the people who rushed to put down a deposit for Valve’s Steam Deck the first moment that I could. However, I pulled out of the queue after seeing how long others were having to wait near its launch. Now, after seeing time and time again that Valve has increased production of the Deck to shorten wait times, it eventually made me rejoin the queue, if only as an experiment to see how quickly I could get to the front of the line.
As it turns out, I only had to wait a month. I placed a deposit for the $529 256GB model on August 25th, and I just received my email confirmation that it was available for purchase. That wasn’t so bad. With a wait this short, there’s no reason to pay higher-than-retail costs for a Deck through sites like StockX or Craigslist unless you’re truly desperate.
Valve originally expected that some reservations wouldn’t be fulfilled until Q4 2022 or later, though the company is now confident that it will meet all of that demand by the end of 2022. That’s remarkable progress, especially since it recently expanded reservations to more regions, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. All the while, it’s been improving the Deck’s software and game compatibility.
So, if you’re thinking of gifting a Steam Deck to yourself or to some lucky person in your life for the holidays, putting down the required $5 deposit at this Steam page should give you a month (if not a little less time) to count up all of your pennies to make sure you have enough.]]></summary>

Substack’s the latest company trying to resurrect Google Reader from the dead — well, in spirit at least. 
Nearly a decade after Google’s popular RSS feed aggregator shut down, Substack has launched a desktop RSS client alternative: Substack Reader for the web.
Now, users can organize all of their Substack subscriptions in one webpage that they can view from their laptop or PC. The app also integrates with third-party RSS feeds so users can check out posts from other publications, too.
The new desktop client keeps old Google Reader users in mind with familiar keyboard shortcuts, for example, yet also sports new settings like dark mode.

Don’t Worry Darling features a Harry Styles love triangle, a possible feud, and maybe some spit. And that’s just behind the scenes! 
 Some people have sports. Some people garden or knit or birdwatch. And some people have the Don’t Worry Darling press tour. 
Personally, everything I’ve learned about the feature film — which stars Florence Pugh and should use a comma after “worry” in its title — has been against my will. I couldn’t tell you the plot (something about ’50s housewives?) but know all too much about the supposed behind-the-scenes drama, from the interviews to the non-interviews, the snubs and the Shia and the spit takes…]]></summary>

It’s a step toward Netflix’s ‘vision to build a world-class games studio’
 Netflix newest investment in video games is opening its first internal game development studio from the ground up, built for the streaming giant from the ground up. 
The new studio — the fourth games studio owned by Netflix — will be based in Helsinki, Finland, and will bolster Netflix’s efforts to bring “engaging original games” to their hundreds of millions of subscribers around the world, vice president of Netflix’s Game Studios said.
So far, the company has focused on buying pre-existing studios to invest in game development. The studio purchased another Helsinki-based studio called Next Games earlier this year, and previously acquired Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Boss Fight Entertainment.
The streaming service features a growing catalogue of games that subscribers can play at no additional cost with no ads on iOS and Android devices. Some highlights include the charming animated platformer Poinpy and Before Your Eyes, which you can literally play by blinking. Sam Barlow’s creepy film-fueled narrative adventure Immortality, will also be added to the streaming service soon.]]></summary>

Childbirth in Westeros remains no easy task, even after a time jump
 House of the Dragon’s sixth episode, “The Princess and the Queen,” was a particularly difficult one for almost everybody on the show. The series picked up 10 years after episode 5, and caught us up with its most important characters, many of whom had had a few kids in the interim. 
Among these characters was Laena Velaryon, daughter of Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen, and now Daemon Targaryen’s second wife. Viewers knew Laena best as the 12-year-old girl from episode 2 who spoke to Viserys about dragons before pitching him on marriage (which he politely declined). Laena and Daemon wound up having two children during the 10-year time jump, and Laena spends most of the sixth episode pre…]]></summary>

 No matter what you want out of Star Wars, we can all agree on one thing: It wouldn’t be the same without the droids.
Big droids, little droids, talkative droids, quiet droids — they’re all (mostly) good, in one way or another. But which are the best? That’s what we’re here to determine today.
We’ve surveyed the esteemed staff of Polygon, mining through the depths of Star Wars droid-dom to find the best and the brightest of our mechanical friends.

Instagram is testing home feeds without a shopping tab, marking a shift in how the platform treats e-commerce. 
Some Instagram users (including some of us here at The Verge) have noted in recent days that the shopping tab, previously on the bottom navigation bar, has been replaced with a notifications tab. Shopping, meanwhile, has been moved to a second menu, buried among options like settings and saved posts.
Meta spokesperson Anne Yeh confirmed the changes as part of a limited test.
“As part of our continued work to simplify your Instagram experience, we are testing a few changes to the main navigation bar at the bottom of the app with a small number of people,” Yeh says.
Moving the tab is a conscious decision on the part of Instagram as t…]]></summary>

Gudetama is easily my favorite Sanrio character, mostly because it’s so relatable: just a little blob of egg who never wants to do anything. Same. In the upcoming Netflix series, dubbed Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure, we get a glimpse at how that might look in the real world. The show sees the egg teaming up with a little chick — who considers them “siblings” — as they leave the fridge into the big wide world. In the show, Gudetama looks much more realistic than its cartoon origins, but the attitude is the same; when it says, “Why bother trying?” I felt a deep connection.


The series starts streaming on December 13th, and the new trailer was a part of a series of Japan-centric announcements from its Tudum event, which also included details on season 2 of Way of the Househusband (it’s coming January 2023), a first look at Junji Ito Maniac: Japanese Tales of the Macabre, and a trailer for a new sci-fi anime called Moonrise. Elsewhere at Tudum, Netflix revealed new details on The Witcher season 3 and the prequel Blood Origin and showed off clips from Enola Holmes 2, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, and They Cloned Tyrone.]]></summary>

Project pitched as ‘a classic Mario game that plays as if Nintendo created it themselves’
 It finally happened, “Super Mario Bros. 5” is here! And by “here” we actually mean “fully realized and created inside Super Mario Maker 2 by a fan, not Nintendo.”
It’s been 32 years since Nintendo launched Super Mario World — the last truly classic Mario Bros. platformer before the modern era — in Japan. Since then we’ve gotten numerous 3D Mario games, modern 2D “New” Super Mario Bros. games, and even Mario games where you can make other Mario games. 
But many fans have wondered over the years: Will Nintendo ever return to the classic era and give us one more great platformer in the style of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World? The answer to that question i…]]></summary>

Apropos of it being Monday, HBO’s dropped the first full-length trailer for its upcoming adaptation of The Last of Us, starring The Mandalorian’s Pedro Pascal as Joel and Game of Thrones’ Bella Ramsey as Ellie. To say that the trailer makes it seem like the show might be something of a banger would be an understatement.
Like Naughty Dog’s games, HBO’s The Last of Us from co-showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann tells the story of Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey), two people living in a world devastated by the outbreak of a deadly fungus that mutates those it infects into horrific monsters. Rather than focusing on the monsters themselves, The Last of Us’ trailer instead puts more energy into spotlighting just how much of its first season will feature Joel and Ellie keeping their wits about them as the world around them continues to go to hell. 
Based just on the handful of shots in the trailer, it’s difficult to say how The Last of Us will stack up to other zombie genre franchises built on the idea of zooming in on human drama during the apocalypse. But if the show ends up being anywhere near as unnerving and haunting as the games, HBO’s take on The Last of Us might be appointment watching when it hits HBO in 2023.]]></summary>

WhatsApp is rolling out a new feature that allows users to share a direct link to a call, making it easier to stay in contact with your loved ones. The Call Links feature will start to appear on WhatsApp this week and can be accessed through a banner located at the top of the Calls tab. WhatsApp users who want to try the Call Link feature will need the latest version of the app.
Mark Zuckerberg announced the feature on Facebook, saying that WhatsApp users will be able to share a link to a call with “a single tap.” The ability to share a call link with up to 32 users was teased back in April during the announcement of another upcoming feature, WhatsApp Communities. 




The Call Links feature will support both audio and video calls, and Zuckerberg also confirmed that encrypted video calling is currently being tested for group calls with up to 32 people, which is notable, as WhatsApp currently caps video calls at eight users. 
Expanded call capacity sets up WhatsApp as a competitor for the likes of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. These rival offerings have a far greater caller capacity (100 for Google and Microsoft Teams and 300 for Zoom). However, they include restrictions like call duration for free accounts and might not be the first choice for the billions of people already chatting on WhatsApp. WhatsApp didn’t mention any restrictions on call duration, which could place it as one of the best free video calling applications for smaller teams and personal networks once the feature is widely available.]]></summary>

Joel and Ellie will arrive on HBO sometime in 2023
 HBO will soon have a new post-apocalyptic world as it premiered the first trailer for The Last of Us on Monday. The network announced the series’ premiere is coming in 2023.
The series is created by Craig Mazin, the creator and writer behind HBO’s Chernobyl. The series will be led by Game of Thrones breakout stars Pedro Pascal, who will play Joel, and Bella Ramsey, who will play Ellie. The series will also include Gabriel Luna (Terminator: Dark Fate) as Tommy and Anna Torv (Mindhunter) as Tess. The series is being developed and executive produced by Neil Druckmann from Naughty Dog, the studio that developed both of The Last of Us video games. 
The Last of Us follows Joel and Ellie as they make their way through a post-apocalyptic United States that’s been ravaged by a mysterious disease that took over peoples’ brains and turned them into dangerous monsters. Along the way they meet all kinds of characters, some friendly, and others that are at least as dangerous as the infected they’re running from. 
The Last of Us will feature 10 episodes in its first season, and there’s been no official announcement of a second season.]]></summary>

Following one of the biggest data breaches in Australian history, the government of Australia is planning to get stricter on requirements for disclosure of cyber attacks.
On Monday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Australian radio station 4BC that the government intended to overhaul privacy legislation so that any company suffering a data breach was required to share details with banks about customers who had potentially been affected to minimize fraud. Under current Australian privacy legislation, companies are prevented from sharing such details about their customers with third parties.
The policy announcement was made in the wake of a huge data breach last week, which affected Australia’s second-largest telecom company Optus. Hackers managed t…]]></summary>

After a year off, E3, the big gaming industry convention, is set to take place from June 13th through June 16th, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and event organizer ReedPop announced on Monday. The event will be back as an in-person show at the Los Angeles Convention Center, and there will be dedicated days for industry attendees and gaming fans to hit the show floor. E3 also plans to support digital gaming events that will take place beginning June 11th.
The “E3 Business Days” will be happening from June 13th through June 15th. These days of the show will be exclusively for games industry attendees for them to network, meet up, and go hands-on with upcoming games. The “E3 Gamer Days” are set for the last two days of the show, June 15th and June 16th, where general consumers will be able to try games and “connect with developers, content creators, media personalities, and more,” according to a press release. There will be specific areas cordoned off just for industry / business attendees, which could make it easier to facilitate meetings. GamesIndustry.biz has a few more specifics on what attendees can expect if you’re interested.
E3 didn’t happen in 2022. It was originally scheduled to take place as an online-only event but was eventually canceled outright. Gaming fans weren’t without a big June gaming extravaganza, though, as Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest filled the void with both a trailer-packed digital showcase and an in-person event for media and influencers.
Summer Game Fest will be back sometime in June as well, with digital and in-person components. With both E3 and Summer Game Fest happening next year, June is shaping up to have an absolute deluge of gaming news and announcements.]]></summary>

According to local reporting, Tesla’s factory fire brigade called for the assistance of local firefighters at 3:33AM, and more than 50 firefighters were involved in helping to extinguish a large burning pile of cardboard, paper, and wood (via Electrek).
The fire occurred on the northeastern side of the property near a recycling facility. Tesla reportedly has a contracted recycling company that shreds materials there, but the cause of the fire remains unknown.

You can have it in any color you want, as long as it’s green, red, or cream. Best Buy and Walmart are currently offering the green, red, or cream colorways of the 41mm Apple Watch Series 7 for its best price ever. The GPS and cellular-equipped configuration of the Series 7 is typically priced at $499 but is available for just $329. While Apple has everyone focused on the new Series 8, the Series 7 is still every bit the excellent Apple wearable we’ve come to expect. The Series 7 offers a larger screen than its predecessor, and it can charge faster than generations that came before it.

Airlines would have to refund passengers for services they paid for that aren’t actually provided, like broken Wi-Fi, under new rules proposed by the Biden administration. Also, airlines and travel search websites would have to disclose upfront any added fees for changing or canceling your flight and for checked or carry-on baggage.
The new rules are part of a slate of changes the US Department of Transportation is proposing to make flying more transparent and consumer-friendly after a particularly rocky summer travel season, in which flight cancellations spiked. The administration has previously sought stricter rules for passenger…]]></summary>

 Editor’s note, September 26, 2022: This article has been updated to reflect recent nuclear tensions between the US and Russia.
On September 26, 1983, the planet came terrifyingly close to a nuclear holocaust.
The Soviet Union’s missile attack early warning system displayed, in large red letters, the word “LAUNCH”; a computer screen stated to the officer on duty, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, that it could say with “high reliability” that an American intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) had been launched and was headed toward the Soviet Union. First, it was just one missile, but then …]]></summary>

 The slice-of-life superhero comedy comic Batman: Wayne Family Adventures will return for a second season this week, Polygon can exclusively reveal, courtesy of Webtoon and DC Comics. 
“Last season, we wanted to focus on the moments that make the Batfamily a family,” writer CRC Payne told Polygon via email. “This season, we’re going to dive deeper into these characters and explore what makes them heroes, both in the everyday sense and in the superhero sense.”

Sanrio’s lazy egg is off to find their mother this December
 Gudetama the lazy egg is getting their own show on Netflix, and the streaming giant released the first trailer over the weekend as part of the Tudum fan event. Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure will premiere on the streaming service later this year, on Dec. 13.
Gudetama’s new Japanese-language Netflix series mixes real actors with CG. The trailer sees Gudetama team up with a tiny chick, Shakipiyo, on an adventure to find their mother — although Gudetama is obviously reluctant to do anything at all. 
The central conflict seems to be that Gudetama is reaching their expiration date and “going bad.” One of the human characters also vows to catch Gudetama, so it seems as if the lazy egg and Shakipiyo will spend some of their time on the run from humans.
Yuko Hara of the Southern All Stars will sing the Gudetama March theme song for the series.
For the uninitiated, Gudetama is a kawaii Japanese anime character created by Sanrio — the same company behind Hello Kitty. They’re an egg yolk with a constantly distressed face and what’s often referred to as “depression,” due to the modern world. They’re like if Winnie the Pooh’s Eeyore was a bright yellow egg instead of a stuffed donkey.
The show’s IMDB page suggests Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure’s first season will run for ten episodes.]]></summary>

Erica Lubman, an indie artist who goes by the moniker Boy Jr., is objectively good at TikTok. She has amassed more than 300,000 followers with her tongue-in-cheek songs and videos spoofing indie rock culture. Those followers have translated into ticket sales for live shows and millions of streams. But even when Lubman gets praise on videos that get half a million views — for her songwriting, for her humor — she is realistic about how fickle TikTok can be.
“I appreciate those comments a ton,” Lubman said. “But there’s a really good chance you won’t see another video from me for months because your TikTok algorithm is going to just show you other things and you’re gonna forget about me.”
On paper, it should be a golden age for music. Anyone with a song in their heart and a subscription to TuneCore can distribute their music on Spotify and other music streamers right alongside Beyoncé. And plenty are taking advantage of it — nearly 75,000 new songs are uploaded every day. So why, as research firm Luminate reported earlier this year, are consumers listening to less new music than before?


In part two of The Vergecast’s series on the future of music, I try to find out why it is so hard for new artists to break out. Speaking with industry experts, I explore the past 25 years of music streaming: from early warnings of the “celestial jukebox” to my personal golden age of music, the MySpace era, to the current boom and bust cycles of streaming today.]]></summary>

 When I reviewed the original Apple Watch SE in 2020, I was certain it was the best option for most people. In fact, my SE review was titled, “Just get the Apple Watch SE.” Back then, the always-on display was relatively new, the bigger screen with thinner bezels hadn’t arrived yet, and advanced features like EKG and blood oxygen monitoring weren’t need-to-haves for most people. (They still aren’t.) But things have changed since then. I no longer believe the SE is the best option for most people. And it’s not that the SE has gotten worse. It’s more that the SE’s role in the Apple Watch lineup has changed.

And there are likely more to come
 One of the challenges of adapting Fire & Blood is that the Game of Thrones prequel is more history book than novel, lacking much of the quirky character moments and meta fantasy jokes that are sprinkled throughout the A Song of Ice and Fire series. Thankfully, George R.R. Martin still finds ways to weave joyful surprises into the book’s detailed Targaryen history lessons.
There’s one particular tidbit from Fire & Blood that I’ve been dying to see make it to screen all season, and in House of the Dragon episode 6, it finally did. But if you weren’t already aware of this potential Easter egg and obsessively looking out for it, then you probably missed the fact that House of the Dragon just made a Muppets reference.

Customers of the consumer genetics and genealogy company Ancestry will soon be able to see which side of the family any DNA matches found through the service come from. The new feature, launching this week, builds on the SideView technology the company announced in April. 
“We’re really excited to see what users can do with this parental matches feature,” says  Caitlyn Bruns, a population geneticist at Ancestry. “I do think it will really help unlock an understanding of how you’re connected with your matches.”
The feature will let users more easily see where matches fall on their family tree. Previously, people could manually place people on one side of their family as they learned more about their matches. Now, it’ll happen automatically. 
The SideView technology leverages Ancestry’s enormous DNA database to sort which parts of a person’s genome came from each parent. When it first launched, it let users see which parts of their ethnicity came from each parent. Ancestry says SideView can have 95 percent precision for 90 percent of customers. 
Next, Ancestry plans to extend SideView to its communities feature, which connects people to groups of other users who might have descended from people who lived in the same area as their ancestors, Bruns says. It’ll group those communities by parental side. 
Once it goes live, this new DNA match feature will be available to users automatically when they log in to their account. 
“This is just something that we’re really excited about that that we can do with the size of our database and not something that other people are able to do at this point,” Bruns says.]]></summary>

Apple has started assembling the iPhone 14 in India, according to reports from TechCrunch and Bloomberg. This marks the first time Apple has shifted production from China to India this quickly after the launch of a new iPhone.
As noted by TechCrunch, Apple’s using Foxconn’s facilities in Sriperumbudur, India, to produce the device. While Apple has produced its flagship iPhones in India in the past, it’s typically done so well after the phone’s initial launch. The company only just started making the iPhone 13 in India in April, and it’s done the same with other models of the iPhone, including the iPhone 12 and 11. 
We first heard that Apple planned on closing the gap between the time it takes to switch production from China to India back in August, with Apple initially hoping to finish making the first iPhones in India in late October. A source familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Apple and Foxconn managed to smooth over supply chain issues, allowing Apple to move production to India faster.
“We’re excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. Apple didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.
Apple first started making iPhones in India in 2017 with the goal of decreasing the company’s reliance on China due to growing conflicts with the US. It also makes the devices more appealing to the Indian market, as locally producing the devices in India can make them more affordable in the country. According to TechCrunch, the standard iPhone 14 currently costs 79,900 rupees (about $980) in India, as opposed to the $799 price tag in the US.
Other companies, like Google, appear to be considering manufacturing hubs outside of China as well. Google is reportedly planning on shifting the production of its Pixel smartphone to India or Vietnam. Samsung has been making devices in the country since 2007 and opened up the world’s largest phone factory in India in 2018.]]></summary>

 Attendees at the 2022 Fantastic Fest film festival in Austin, Texas were the first to see Marvel’s hour-long black-and-white Halloween special Werewolf by Night on Sunday night, at one of the film festival’s Secret Screenings. Director Michael Giacchino — the composer for The Batman, Thor: Love and Thunder, and Pixar’s Ratatouille, Up, Coco, The Incredibles, and Inside Out, among dozens of other films — called in for a remote Q&A after the screening to explain how the project, premiering on Disney Plus on Oct. 7, came about, and why it looks and feels so radically different from any other Marvel Studios project.

The City of London police report they’ve arrested a 17-year-old in Oxfordshire on suspicion of hacking and said he remains in custody. In a follow-up tweet the next day, the police confirmed the teen has been charged with two counts of breach of bail conditions and two counts of computer misuse. A hearing was scheduled for Saturday, but as of Monday morning, no further details have been released.
Police declined to say what incident the arrest was in connection with, but many of the details line up with recent high-profile hacks.

Revealed Saturday during the Aniplex Online Fest 2022 livestream, both trailers offer a first look at the adaptation’s version of 2B and 9S, two of the android protagonists of Nier: Automata who fight as soldiers in the elite military force YoRHa against an invasion of alien robots on behalf of humanity.

The flagship Ryzen 9 7950X chip is priced at $699 and features 16 cores, 32 threads, and a boost clock of up to 5.7GHz.

Previously only an option on Echo Show devices (speakers with touchscreens), it’s now available on Amazon’s Fire tablets, eighth-generation or newer, in the US, UK, Germany, and Japan. 
With Tap to Alexa enabled, a small “tap” icon sits on the screen that, when tapped, opens a dashboard of common c…]]></summary>

For 72 hours after it happened, Brian Chin hardly left the building. He didn’t sleep. He didn’t eat. He had arrived at 111 Chrystie, the 23-unit apartment complex his family owns in the heart of Chinatown, at a little before 6 a.m. on February 13 after getting a call from one of his tenants. It was a chaotic scene: The street in front of the building was blocked off, NYPD squad cars and officers everywhere. The police let Chin inside, but no one would tell him what was going on. Outside, the sky was black. Snow was lightly falling. Inside, an alarm blared through the building until a cop took a sledgehammer and silenced it. Finally, an officer told Chin t…]]></summary>

Long-distance trains in the US are very slow, but it’s much more environmentally friendly and rewarding.
 Last year, I took the Amtrak from Chicago to San Francisco in coach, and loved it so much that I did it again. So this summer, I decided to take four more long-distance trains: San Francisco to Seattle, Seattle to Chicago, Chicago to New Orleans, and New Orleans to Los Angeles. (I flew from Los Angeles home to San Francisco because of timing issues, which is a big problem with US rail — something we’ll get into later.)
Along the way, I learned about America. I saw the quaint lakes of the Upper Midwest, the humid clouds of the Mississippi Delta, the breathtaking mountains of Montana, and the endless hills of West Texas. I saw beautiful sunsets in nort…]]></summary>

The model’s output isn’t flawless, but it’s incredibly entertaining all the same. You can try punching in the names of celebrities or politicians (see “Boris Johnson” and “Vladimir Putin” in the image above), or just general descriptions of the sort of Pokémon that would tickle your personal fancy (the one below is my “skeleton priest”).

Oxenfree 2: Lost Signals has been delayed to 2023, its developer Night School Studio has announced.  “To make Oxenfree II truly special and add more localizations, we’re moving our release window to 2023,” the developer’s statement reads. “Thank you for your patience, support, and understanding. We can’t wait to share the game with you. Stay tuned!”
This is the second major delay to have hit the sequel to the acclaimed 2016 adventure horror game. Lost Signals was originally announced in 2021 and planned for release later that year. But just a few short months later the game’s developers announced a delay to “early 2022.” No specific reason was given for the delays beyond ensuring the game is “the experience we believe it should be.”
An update on OXENFREE II: Lost Signals pic.twitter.com/bEcwrvHUR9
— Night School Studio (@nightschoolers) September 24, 2022



Night School Studio was acquired by Netflix last year as part of the streaming service’s push into mobile gaming, and just days ago an iOS and Android port of the original 2016 Oxenfree was released. The title is now available at no additional cost to Netflix subscribers, with no ads or in-app purchases. 
Set five years after the original game, Oxenfree 2 follows new protagonist Riley as she returns to her hometown to investigate some mysterious radio signals that seem eerily similar to those from the original game. The game is currently scheduled to come out on Windows, Mac, PlayStation consoles, and the Nintendo Switch. Although a mobile version doesn’t appear to have been officially announced, we’d be very surprised if it didn’t also end up on iOS and Android since mobile gaming-focused Netflix is serving as its publisher.]]></summary>

When NASA smashes a spacecraft into an asteroid on Monday, people on Earth will get an extremely close look at the action. 
NASA’s Double Asteroid Redirect Test (DART) is headed for its final destination, the surface of an asteroid called Dimorphos, which it will crash into at speeds of over 14,000 miles per hour. Researchers are hoping that the collision will change the asteroid’s orbit, speeding it up just a tiny bit. 
Neither Dimorphos, nor its larger companion, Didymos, pose any danger to Earth, but the experiment is designed to test whether or not a similar impact could make a difference if scientists ever discovered an asteroid that posed an imminent threat to life on Earth.

The Republican justices who overruled Roe v. Wade are only getting started.
 The headline of this piece is likely to turn a few heads. The Supreme Court’s last term, after all, was an orgy of conservative excess unlike any since the Court’s Great Depression-era attacks on the New Deal. And it culminated in the demise of Roe v. Wade, arguably the most closely watched Supreme Court decision since the justices declared school segregation unconstitutional in 1954.

Cameron Green and Tim David scored the bulk of runs as Australia put 186 for 7 after being invited to bat.

The victory against Australia also marked Rohit Sharma's 33rd win as India's T20I captain, putting him ahead of Kohli. The Indian team has had four captains in T20s this year with Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant leading the side. Post the win, Rohit shared a few pictures on social media and captioned it as, "CHARACTER 🇮�🇳�."

A guide to Rhaenyra, Alicent, and Daemon’s post-time jump children
 Time jumps are critical to how House of the Dragon is telling its story about a tumultuous moment in Targaryen history. None of those time jumps are as important as the 10-year leap  episode 6 takes. While much has changed in King’s Landing in the time the show skipped, one shift that has the potential to confuse audiences is the addition of so many new characters, in the form of the children of Alicent, Rhaenyra, and Daemon. 
To help you keep track of all six children that appeared this episode (including five new ones), here’s a breakdown of Rhaenyra and Alicent’s respective families:

And episode 6 was his coming-out party
 The sixth episode of House of the Dragon introduced an element to the show audiences had been expecting for a while: a big time jump. New actors have stepped in to play old roles, and a host of new characters have been introduced in the 10-year gap between episodes 5 and 6.
But the character whose role in the show increased the most in that time skip was present (and played by the same actor) before that 10-year gap: Larys Strong (portrayed by Matthew Needham). Who is he, and what’s his whole deal? We’re here to help, dear reader.

We’re now 10 years closer to all that fire and blood
 One creative decision has been looming over House of the Dragon since the August premiere of the show: A 10-year time jump right in the middle of the show’s first season, one that would mark new actors assuming the lead roles of Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower. With a few exceptions — like those who play the children of Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), who are each portrayed by three sets of actors throughout the season — Rhaenyra and Alicent are the only two main cast members to swap performers after the time jump. This has made the mid-season decade leap forward feel unusually weighty — and for the most part, House of the Dragon does not make a big deal of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That poor Surface tablet.
    

  
Microsoft Surface tablets have been taking a beating at football events these past two weekends. During the Buffalo Bills game against the Miami Dolphins this afternoon, Bills offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey took his frustration out on his tablet as the Dolphins secured a win during the final moments of the game.
Dorsey’s reaction may have been warranted, although he probably could’ve chosen another outlet for his anger (like a stress ball perhaps?). The Bills had a chance to run one more play to win the game, but the team ultimately ran out of time, losing to the Dolphins 19-21. When cameras turned to the booth where he was watching the game, Dorsey ripped off his headset and tossed his hat before he picked up the tablet and started violently slamming it against his desk. 
What an ending to the Bills-Dolphins game! #BUFvsMIA pic.twitter.com/yjlc3H0wUi
— NFL (@NFL) September 25, 2022



Last weekend, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady spiked a Surface tablet into the ground after his team made an incomplete pass when they faced off against the Saints. This temper tantrum even caught the eye of Microsoft Surface chief Panos Panay, who responded by saying “Rest assured the Surface should be just fine.”
Microsoft partnered with the NFL back in 2014 to replace the paper-based system of reviewing plays on the sidelines with Surface tablets. Since then, the tablets have seen abuse from Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Patriots coach Bill Belichick, and, of course, Tom Brady, who’s been caught tossing the tablet twice so far.]]></summary>

Dimorphos is a lump of space rock so far away from Earth that we don’t even know what it looks like — and on Monday, we’re going to smash it with a spacecraft. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) will be traveling at more than 14,000 miles per hour when it hits the asteroid, in what has to be one of the most metal science experiments of all time. 
DART is a NASA effort to see if it can change an asteroid’s movement in space. It’s being billed as the world’s first “planetary defense test mission” —  a test run to see if we have what it takes to avert a serious asteroid impact on Earth sometime in the future. You know, just in case.

DirecTV’s NFL Sunday Ticket hasn’t had a very good start to the football season. For the past two weekends in a row, subscribers have struggled to get their streams to work, and this weekend is no exception.
Even before today’s games started, users began complaining about numerous issues, with many saying that they can’t log into their accounts on the Sunday Ticket website or app and others having problems loading the streams. Those who are able to access the stream are reporting quality issues.
Somehow Sunday Ticket is acting worse than last week. Truly depressing. @DIRECTV
— Alex Reno (@alex_reno) September 25, 2022



DirecTV hasn’t issued any statement about whether it’s working to fix the stream, and the company didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. In a response to one user’s issue on Twitter, DirecTV said “we know some customers can’t access NFL Sunday Ticket online or through the app” and that its “teams are working to resolve this.” Aside from DirecTV, users trying to stream football through CBS on Paramount Plus are also reporting problems.
In what will probably come as a relief to football fans, DirecTV’s rights to NFL Sunday Ticket expire at the end of this football season. This leaves room for another company to snap up the rights to Sunday Ticket, with Apple, Amazon, Disney, and Google reportedly looking to air Sunday Ticket on each of their respective streaming services. 
So far, Amazon Prime Video’s showing of Thursday Night Football has shown some promise. The streamer’s first-ever live football game performed a heck of a ton better than DirecTV for the past few weeks, even with some minor blips here and there.]]></summary>

Apple could introduce a new naming scheme when it releases the iPhone 15 next year, replacing the current “Pro Max” branding with “Ultra.” This is according to Apple tracker Mark Gurman, who also expects the iPhone 15 to come with some “bigger changes,” including USB-C.
The Pro Max name first appeared with the iPhone 11 in 2019, and adding Ultra branding to the iPhone lineup wouldn’t be all that surprising. Apple already launched the new Watch Ultra with the moniker earlier this month, and added the name to its M1 Ultra processor. Apple also introduced a minor change to its naming scheme with the iPhone 14, bringing back the seemingly retired “Plus” name to the iPhone 14 Plus.

Shooting action over 50? No problem for these stars
 In the crowded field of Netflix original programming vying for viewer attention, it’s difficult to stand out and be noticed. There has to be something that causes the endless scrolling to stop for a moment, for the potential viewer to linger on a title in hopes that it will intrigue enough to warrant a press of the play button — a hook.
The latest original film from the streaming giant, Lou, about a desperate mother’s attempt to rescue her kidnapped child from the wilderness with the aid of a mysterious hardened tracker, certainly has an intriguing hook. The grizzled hero with a mysterious past aiding the mother is portrayed by the unconventional choice of Allison Janney (I, Tonya). People might s…]]></summary>

Apple Pay Later is facing some “significant” setbacks that could delay its launch until next year, according to a report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The feature is Apple’s version of a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service, letting you make a payment through Apple Pay and then pay it back in four installments without interest.
Apple said its Pay Later feature would arrive with iOS 16 when it first announced the program at WWDC in June.

 Spending a grip on a gaming laptop isn’t difficult; a cursory search on gaming laptops will net you several options that cost more than $4,000. But finding a laptop that’s giving you the greatest return on your investment is more of a challenge. If you’re spending around $3,000 on a gaming laptop like the Acer Predator Triton 500 SE, you want it to bury the competition, not just scrape by. Unfortunately, the Triton 500 SE is a bit disappointing and doesn’t flex its hardware enough to set it apart in a crowded market. 
Housed in its all-silver chassis, the $2,999.99 configuration of the Triton 500 SE we tested includes a 12th Gen Core i9-12900H processor, RTX 3080 Ti graphics card, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of…]]></summary>

James Earl Jones has been the iconic voice of Darth Vader since the beginning of Star Wars, but at 91 years old, it seems he’s ready to have the work done for him. According to a report from Vanity Fair (via Deadline), Jones signed over the rights to his archival voice work, allowing the Ukrainian startup Respeecher to leverage AI technology and recreate the sound of his voice in Disney Plus’ Obi-Wan Kenobi.
To do this, Respeecher uses sound bites to “clone” an actor’s voice, allowing a studio to record new lines without having the actor present. Matthew Wood, Skywalker Sound’s supervising sound editor, told Vanity Fair that he presented Jones with the option once he “mentioned he was looking into winding down” the role of Da…]]></summary>

Italy’s potential far-right turn is years in the making.
 Giorgia Meloni, the founder of the hard-right party Brothers of Italy, could soon become Italy’s first woman leader and the first far-right leader in decades, since the fall of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini during World War II.
Italy will hold snap general elections on Sunday to elect a new parliament, and Meloni’s party is widely considered the favorite to come out on top as the leading partner in a new conservative coalition, with Meloni as prime minister.

Big names like The Witcher, Knives Out, Enola Holmes, and Bridgerton all made appearances on the livestream
 For a second year in a row, Netflix held a livestreamed event called Tudum to show off some of its biggest upcoming movies, TV shows, and now games. (Though the names are the same, this Tudum has nothing to do with the struggling fansite also managed by Netflix.) There were a few notable absences from the 2022 edition — I’m still waiting to hear or see something about season 2 of Arcane — but there were also plenty of big names. That includes news about two different Witcher shows, trailers for Enola Holmes and Knives Out, and the surprise launch of an excellent indie game.

In Netflix’s upcoming sci-fi comedy feature The Cloned Tyrone from director Juel Taylor, everybody with even the slightest bit of common sense knows that Black people have plenty of reasons not to trust the government or the police stalking their neighborhoods. Some of those reasons, like police brutality and harassment, are obvious. But the real threat everyone’s facing in They Cloned Tyrone’s first trailer is a bit more hidden and insidious because it’s the sort of thing few people would be inclined to believe.
They Cloned Tyrone tells the story of Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris), Slick (Jamie Foxx), and Fontaine (John Boyega), three unlikely friends who are brought together by their shared discovery of a massive, secret governmental surveillance plan to monitor the lives of Black people before disappearing them and replacing them with clones. It’s hard to tell from They Cloned Tyrone’s trailer just what the end goal of snatching folks up is, or how three conspiracy theorists are supposed to take down that sort of operation on their own. But it does seem like They Cloned Tyrone’s going to have one hell of a good time reminding people what the concept of staying woke actually means when it hits Netflix on December 30th.]]></summary>

At the beginning of the month Netflix gave us our first taste of the first Knives Out sequel, and at its Tudum event the streamer showed off another clip — this one focused on some very complex puzzle boxes that double as a party invite. The brief clip showed off the mixture of humor and mystery that you’d expect from another Knives Out.
Glass Onion is an important movie for Netflix, and not just because it’s a centerpiece of the company’s holiday schedule. The company reportedly paid more than $400 million for two sequels to Rian Johnson’s original whodunit, and Glass Onion also features a star-studded cast including the likes of Janelle Monáe, Leslie Odom Jr., David Bautista, Jessica Henwick, Kathryn Hahn, Kate Hudson, and Edward Norton, alongside star Daniel Craig.
Knives Out is just one of several cinematic universes that Netflix is hoping to turn into its next big film franchise.
Glass Onion starts streaming on Netflix on December 23rd, and will be in select theaters before that. In the meantime, you can check out our spoiler-free review.]]></summary>

Fear not, Witcher fans: The prequel series Blood Origin arrives Christmas Day
 Netflix’s 2022 Tudum event gave fans updates on two upcoming projects in the Witcher universe. The third season of The Witcher, starring Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia, will arrive in summer 2023. The limited series prequel spinoff The Witcher: Blood Origin, starring the incomparable Michelle Yeoh, will arrive on Netflix Christmas Day.
The poster for the third season of The Witcher shows a broken version of Geralt’s wolf medallion, and also features a small bird in the same style as the medallion.

In the poster for Blood Origin, we see a pair of arms holding weapons, forming an X. Both arms are tattooed with images of animals — the one holding an ax appears to have a wolf tattoo, while the arm with a shorter blade has a bird tattoo.
Season 2 of The Witcher opened with arguably the best episode the show’s ever had, and the long gap between seasons changed some plans and set up both season 3 and Blood Origin. We’ll have to wait a bit longer to see if season 3 can live up to that, but at least we’ll have Blood Origin in the meantime.]]></summary>

Yet another beloved indie game is now available on Netflix. At its Tudum event today, Netflix announced that the supernatural thriller Oxenfree, which first launched in 2016, is now playable through its fledgling games service. The Netflix version of Oxenfree is available as a free download to Netflix subscribers on both iOS and Android, and features subtitle support for more than 30 languages.
Netflix has steadily been adding excellent games like Into the Breach, Before Your Eyes, and Lucky Luna to its mobile gaming offerings, but Oxenfree is particularly notable because Netflix acquired its developer, Night School Studio, last year. Oxenfree also feels like a good fit for Netflix, with its focus on storytelling and a vibe that’ll appeal to Stranger Things fans. A sequel is also in the works.


Elsewhere, Netflix announced two games that will be launching on September 27th: Spongebob: Get Cooking and Desta: The Memories Between, which is developed by Monument Valley studio Ustwo. Other games listed as “coming soon” include a mobile version of the acclaimed Kentucky Route Zero and a baking game based on the Netflix series Nailed It.
Netflix started its foray into gaming late last year, though early reports suggest that it hasn’t caught on with the majority of subscribers yet.]]></summary>

When Netflix announced during last year’s Tudum that a third season of The Witcher was already on the way, there was some hope that maybe, just maybe Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia would be back on our screens slaying demons in time for the upcoming holiday season. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case, and there’s going to be a bit of a wait, but not an especially long one.
While there was no new footage from The Witcher’s third season shown at this year’s Tudum presentation, Cavill and co-stars Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan a made brief appearances to share some teaser art and to announce that the series will return in 2023. 
Taken at face value, there isn’t all that much to glean from the teaser art, which features the wolf, swallow, and obsidian star symbols associated with Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefir in Netflix’s adaptation of The Witcher. But the way Geralt’s wolf medallion — a powerful magic tool — is broken in the art could be a nod to how Geralt’s original medallion is destroyed in The Tower of the Swallow, the fourth novel in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher Saga. 
Netflix’s series, CD Projekt Red’s video games, and Sapkowski’s novels are all very different beasts. But it wouldn’t at all be surprising to see a rather major moment from the source material becoming one of The WItcher’s big season 3 plot points when it returns some time next summer.]]></summary>

While the third season of Netflix’s live-action Witcher series still doesn’t have an actual premiere date, the wait for Declan de Barra and Lauren Schmidt Hissrich’s upcoming The Witcher: Blood Origin prequel series is almost over.
Netflix’s The Witcher: Blood Origin hits Netflix on December 25th. And while we didn’t get a new trailer for the series — which tells the story of the very first witcher, long before Geralt’s iconic adventures — we did learn that Minnie Driver will be joining the cast, where she’ll star alongside the likes of Michelle Yeoh.
While you wait, you can check out the very first teaser for the series right here — and a brand new poster below.

Once upon a time, it seemed as if Netflix’s upcoming stop-motion Pinocchio from co-directors Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson’s might in a bit of competition with Disney’s “live-action” spin on the classic story from Robert Zeemckis. But that all changed when del Toro stopped by Netflix’s annual Tudum event to give everyone a closer look into the labor-intensive, mesmerizing, and magical process that brought his Pinocchio to life.
In the new video, which features a number of different Pinocchio scenes in the midst of production, del Toro opens up a bit about what all he wanted to bring to his take on the fairytale, and why he insisted that the bulk of its animation was done by hand. 
While there’s also quite a bit of digital production involved in the film’s making, del Toro explained how the minute imperfections that come with hand-made stop motion art have a way of making stories like this feel more magical because they give you a sense of how the overall process works.
“I really wanted this movie to land in a way that had the expressiveness and the material nature of a handmade piece of animation — an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,” del Toro explains. “But it had the sophistication of movement that research in rigs and puppetry-making have taken us.”
 Pinocchio is set to hit Netflix on December 9th.]]></summary>

The unlikely hit premieres in November
 Manifest is back from the dead with the first trailer for its fourth and final season, this time with Netflix. The series is bringing back creator Jeff Rake for the new season, as well as its stars including Melissa Roxburgh, Josh Dallos, Athena Karkanis, and J.R. Ramirez. 
The first look at Manifest season 4 debuted during Netflix’s Tudum event on Saturday. The show’s final season will include 20 episodes, with the first batch arriving on Nov. 4. 
Manifest follows the passengers aboard an international flight that hits severe turbulence and has to be diverted. Though the plane lands safely, the passengers learn that they’re been gone for more than five years. Along with trying to piece their lives back together, the survivors also starts to experience strange voices and visions.
The series originally aired on NBC, but was canceled in 2021 after its third season. Manifest then made its way onto Netflix, where it quickly became the platform’s most watched series, reaching a whole new audience. This surge in popularity caused Netflix itself to pick up the rights to the series and greenlight this final season.]]></summary>

This new teaser is only 41 seconds long, but it’s filled with so much. For one, two fan favorite characters make their first appearances: Ravkan prince Nikolai Lanstov, as played by The OA’s Patrick Gibson, appears in the first moments of the teaser talking to Alina; later on in the clip, Jack Wolfe appears as Wylan — the sixth member of the Six of Crows, though canonically in the timeline he hasn’t really met the others yet. Also appearing are ruthless mercenaries Tamar and Tolya, played by Anna Leong Brophy (Traces) and Lewis Tan (Mortal Kombat) respectively. 
Of course, we also see Jessie Mei Li as Alina Starkov, powerful Sun Summoner, and Ben Barnes as the ruthless, yet captivating Darkling — along with the shadowy Six of Crows characters and everyone else from the first season. 
The second season of Shadow and Bone is expected to follow the events of the second book in the main trilogy, Storm and Siege. But like the first season of the show, the new batch of episodes will also incorporate characters not seen until later books in order to flesh out the storylines.]]></summary>

It’s tough being Sherlock Holmes’ little sister 
 Enola Holmes is back — and this time, she has a detective agency of her own. Netflix released the first trailer for the sequel, due out this November, at the company’s Tudum fan event.
As it turns out, trying to establish yourself as a private investigator is particularly tough when you are (1) a girl, (2) a teenager, and (3) the younger sister of the esteemed Sherlock Holmes. But Enola’s luck changes when a young factory girl brings her a case — the girl’s sister has been missing for a week and it’s up to Enola to solve the case. 
Enola Holmes 2 finds Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown reprising her role as the charming Enola. Henry Cavill once again plays a particularly hunky iteration of Sherlock Holmes, with Helena Bonham Carter as the Holmes’ siblings eccentric mother (in the first movie, The Hunger Games’ Sam Claflin played stuffy eldest brother Mycroft, but it’s not clear if he’s returning for this one). Additionally, Louis Partridge returns as Viscount Tewkesbury, the missing young lord from the first movie who strikes up a friendship with Enola.

Iran is in revolt.
 It was not an isolated incident of police violence in Iran. But the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody last week has captured the country’s attention. 
Amini was visiting the capital of Tehran, coming from the Kurdish province in the country’s northwest, and Iran’s so-called morality police detained her, allegedly for wearing the mandatory headscarf improperly. Several hours after entering police custody, she was in a coma. She died two days later. Iranian police claimed she died after a stroke and suffering cardiac arrest, but witnesses say she died after sustain…]]></summary>

How a WWE wrestler, corrupt Mississippi officials, and Brett Favre allegedly siphoned money away from poor people.
 We live in an age of brazen, ham-handed grift. Have you heard the one involving the retired NFL star, a WWE wrestler, corrupt Southern officials, and the millions in welfare money that they benefited from? 
If you’ve heard about this scandal, it’s likely because of the involvement of former Green Bay Packer Brett Favre, specifically the $1 million in federal welfare money he received for talks he apparently did not give and the $5 million he was involved in directing toward construction of a volleyball stadium at the college his daught…]]></summary>

One of the best movies of the year is one of many leaving streaming this month
 Fall is finally upon us, and with it comes a whole season of movies to choose from. Before we can get to those, though, we have to pick out the very best of what’s streaming in September before they float away like so many leaves. 
We’ve got a fantastic crop of films to choose from in the form of David Prior’s 2020 breakout horror film The Empty Man, Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2, and Michael Bay’s action heist thriller Ambulance, not to mention classics like Alain Resnais’ avant-garde masterpiece Last Year at Marienbad, 1999’s The Mummy, and more.
Without further ado, here are 19 of the best movies to watch before they leave streaming in September.

His legal problems are worsening. But they might not take him down.
 Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: New developments have put Donald Trump in even more serious legal jeopardy.
A new civil fraud lawsuit from the New York attorney general’s office is threatening his business, while his efforts to stall the criminal investigation into whether he mishandled classified information seem to have failed. And a separate investigation into the January 6 attack scrutinizes his associates.
It all looks quite bad for him. Then again, for at least five years, much of the media has touted the seriousness of Trump’s legal peril, portraying…]]></summary>

 Giorgia Meloni and her far-right Fratelli d’Italia are expected to lead a far right victory in Italian elections this weekend. That win, if it happens, would come shortly after the far-right Sweden Democrats won the second-largest share of the vote, helping to oust the center-left from power and giving the far right a potential role in the next government.

The record-breaking anime feature finally comes to streaming this week
 This weekend sees the premiere of Athena, the explosive French thriller epic from acclaimed music video director Romain Gavras on Netflix, as well as the highly anticipated streaming premiere of the record-breaking Jujutsu Kaisen 0 anime film on Crunchyroll. If neither of those strike your fancy, not to worry — this week is practically bursting at the seams with exciting new movies to stream and rent on VOD.
We’ve got the action thriller Lou starring Allison Janney (The West Wing) and Jurnee Smollett (Lovecraft Country) and the Tyler Perry-directed period romance drama A Jazzman’s Blues on Netflix, the time-hopping romance comedy Meet Cute on Peacock, the Oprah Winfrey-produced Sidney Poitier…]]></summary>

Sony’s PC outreach continues with another PlayStation exclusive
 Step aside Peter Parker. It’s Miles Morales’ turn for a Windows PC port. Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is coming to Windows PC and it got its first teaser trailer on Friday.  There’s no specific release date yet, but it’s scheduled to launch this fall. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales is currently available on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. The port will give Windows users the change to experience the glittering adventure for themselves. The teaser trailer shows Miles Morales in his sleek and shiny spider-suit, slinging webs and stomping bad guys to protect New York City.
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales features a lot of similar gameplay and locales as Insomniac Games’ 2018 hit Marvel’s Spider-Man. But it still delivers an original story starring Miles Morales in the hero’s role. In this 2020 adaptation, Peter Parker is out of town, so it’s up to Morales to keep the peace in New York. 
Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales may not have a launch date, but players can wishlist it on Steam and the Epic Games Store.]]></summary>

Sauron? Or just Some-guy-ron? 
 The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power has kept one thing secret and safe for the entirety of its production: Who in the show is playing the role of chief antagonist, the infamous Dark Lord Sauron? In the show’s third episode, we got another character to toss into the pile of Sauron Potentials. And then, in the fifth episode, that theory was uttered out loud.

No Church in the Wild director Romain Gavras brings the righteous fire
 Athena, the latest film from music video director Romain Gavras, is a one-trick pony, but that trick is so formally dazzling that the movie is an enrapturing experience. Composed of several lengthy, labyrinthine takes spaced out by traditionally edited scenes, it follows three French-Algerian brothers in Paris — young and middle-aged adults from different walks of life — thrown into disarray in the immediate aftermath of a harrowing family tragedy.
Their youngest sibling, a child named Idir, has been murdered, and the culprits caught on camera appear to be French police. The oldest brother, Moktar (Ouassini Embarek), is a drug and weapons trafficker who only looks out for…]]></summary>

Amazon’s show adds a new legend to Tolkien’s legendarium
 Despite its status as a prequel, Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power still has plenty to teach us about the history of Middle-earth, or at least its version of that history. While the show’s latest episode covers many different bases, perhaps its most interesting has to do with the history of mithril, a legendary elf, and the Misty Mountains themselves. 
[Ed. note: This post contains spoilers for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power episode 5, “Partings.”]

He’ll be joining his grandson Morty 
 Rick Sanchez, the eccentric genius from the popular Adult Swim series Rick and Morty, will be the next playable character to join the roster of MultiVersus. We don’t have a release date yet, but publisher Warner Bros. Games says he will come to the game “soon.”
You can catch a glimpse of Rick in a teaser trailer that was released Friday. The match starts off with a fight between Wonder Woman and Reindog. Suddenly, their battle is interrupted by the appearance of a green portal, with blue humanoid alien creatures called Mr. Meeseeks emerging from it. The trailer ends with Rick exiting the portal and letting out a giant belch.
Rick will be a “mage / ranged” character, according to his description on the game’s website. He is following his grandson Morty, who was added to MultiVersus in August as part of the season 1.01 patch.
MultiVersus is a free-to-play fighting game featuring a roster of fighters from various Warner Bros. properties. When he arrives, Rick Sanchez will join characters like Batman and Superman on the fighting stage. If you want to see who else you can play as, we have a full list of all current and upcoming characters.]]></summary>

 Kicking off a new tabletop role-playing game with a small group of friends is hard. There’s getting six people’s schedules to line up bit, of course, which is always a chore. But learning a new game system requires study, and rolling up four or five new characters takes time. Game developer One More Multiverse wants to help, and it’s producing a set of tabletop tools to make playing with your friends online a lot easier. The venture capital-backed team is going at things very differently than its competitors. Whether you’re a potential newbie player or a long-suffering Dungeon Master, you should at least consider giving the demo a try.

Circumstances match other arrests linked to major breaches
 London police have arrested a teenager on suspicion of hacking offenses, authorities said on Friday. The 17-year-old suspect was arrested in Oxfordshire, England as part of an ongoing investigation with the government’s National Cyber Crime Unit. Police declined to confirm any other details regarding the arrest and investigation — just that the suspect is in custody.
That said, the circumstances follow earlier arrests connected to a hacker group that is said to be responsible for breaches at Uber and Rockstar Games, the latter of which led to leaked footage of the in-development Grand Theft Auto 6 published over the weekend.

For those neither versed in the writings of J.R.R.

Playing Hyper Demon, the latest first-person shooter by Devil Daggers developer Sorath, is kind of like staring into one of those — but instead of mind-melting horrors, it has rocket jumps and a leaderboard.

The series hasn’t missed a beat in its transition to half-hour television
 If you, like me, were terminally online around the early 2010s, you probably know, love, and have sorely missed Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared. 
Co-created by animators Becky Sloan and Joseph Pelling, the six-episode web series set a fire across the Internet when it was released on YouTube between 2011 and 2015, with a unique blend of puppet-based antics and Lynchian shock humor. The animated shorts have since amassed over 216 million collective views on YouTube and inspired everything from elaborate fan theories involving Serbian war criminals to a small clothing line. Now, over six years since the last short, Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared has finally returned as a half-hour television seri…]]></summary>

New information from Splatoon 3 casts doubt on his record
 Splatoon 3 imagines an alternate world where ocean creatures, instead of mammals, took over the land. The game is set in a post-postapocalyptic world where humanity has been wiped out and sentient ocean life has taken its place. The signature character of the series, an Inkling, can take on both the form of a kid and a squid. There are a few exceptions to the game’s theme, however, including Li’l Judd, a cat who helps referee your matches. But now, a shadow of speculation has been cast on the adorable fuzzball due to new information revealed in Splatoon 3.

Dead Reckoning and 3,000 Scoundrels use clear cards to build replayable games
 Many board game publishers make a tidy profit on upgraded components — things like metal coins and card sleeves that make their products more appealing at the table. But some companies are building entire games around these kinds of bits. Just look at the poker-style chips and custom dice that Chip Theory Games uses, or the neoprene game board at the center of Leder Games’ Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile. This year, yet another rare and expensive component has had its breakout moment: clear plastic playing cards.

An epic drought in the West is drying up the river. But that’s only part of the story.
 By now, you may have heard that the Colorado River is drying up. 
The river’s flow is down by about 20 percent, compared to the 1900s, and the two largest reservoirs it feeds are less than a third full. The water in Lake Mead, the nation’s biggest reservoir, has dropped more than 150 feet in the last two decades, leaving little water for the more than 40 million people who depend on the river.

House Democrats used a recent vote to show voters they are for the police.

Democrats tried to strike a delicate balance with this package: While it includes more grant money for police, it also contains bills that would invest in reform efforts activists favor such as community-based violence interventions and first responders who are trained specifically to address mental…]]></summary>

Maw and Disorder puts Sylvanas on the stand
 Hearthstone is due for another mini-set, and while Blizzard has just left the Shadowlands behind for the next World of Warcraft expansion, the trading card game’s current expansion is Murder at Castle Nathria, a mystery murder set in the vampiric domain of Revendreth. A murder is usually followed by a trial, and that is the case here — the next mini-set is Maw and Disorder, and it’s themed around the trial of Sylvanas Windrunner.
Sylvanas was the main antagonist of World of Warcraft for some time, starting in the Battle for Azeroth expansion and concluding in Shadowlands. It looks like Hearthstone intends to take a significantly sillier take on her appearance; for instance, Sylvanas’ new Legendary card is revealed with a cheesy spinning newspaper reveal.
When she hits the stand, everyone will know. ‍⚖️

— Hearthstone (@PlayHearthstone) September 22, 2022



It doesn’t look like this is the same trial that Sylvanas faced in World of Warcraft either, where she stood in front of Tyrande Whisperwind and her former colleagues to admit fault for all of her war crimes. This time, it looks like Sylvanas is facing off against the Jailer, the end boss of Shadowlands, in court.
The mini-set will reveal of 35 new cards: four legendary, one epic, 14 rare, and 16 common cards. Players can either find these cards in Murder at Castle Nathria packs or as a Mini-Set bundle.]]></summary>
