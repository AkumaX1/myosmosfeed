          "description": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nNew York Attorney General Letitia James is suing crypto company Nexo, alleging that the company misled customers by saying it was registered to sell securities and commodities and that it wasn’t approved to offer services like its “Earn Interest Product” that promised returns on deposited crypto. It’s the latest legal move in a fight between regulators and crypto companies looking to offer interest-earning accounts, often insisting that they shouldn’t be classified as securities.\nSeven other states — California, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Washington, and Vermont — are also filing “administrative actions” against the company, according to a press release from the New York AG.

Right now, Sony is selling the disc-based PlayStation 5 with a digital copy of Guerrilla Games’ excellent Horizon Forbidden West for $549.99, which is $10 less than the cost if you were to buy the two individually. The best part? You don’t even have to wait in line in order to pick one up.\nWhile we’ve been seeing Sony and other retailers offer stock for longer than usual recently, speed is still the name of the game here. We can’t suggest any hacks that will guarantee you’ll land the console today, but as detailed in our guide on how to buy a PS5, there are a few things you can do to improve your chance of securing one. For one, remember that you must log in with your PlayStation Network ID to buy a PlayStation 5 from Sony, so make sure you have your username and password ready. Also, be aware that you can only buy one console per account, so don’t waste time trying to buy more than one.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t manage to land a console today, be sure to check back in with us. Restock events such as this are not as rare as they once were, and we routinely call out stock whenever we see it at Amazon, Target, Best Buy, and other retailers.\nCheck out these PS5 accessories and games\nIn the meantime, it could be wise to start preparing for your new PS5 with some fun accessories and games.

According to South Korean publication Yonhap and The New York Times, South Korean prosecutors said that Interpol has issued a “red notice” asking for help from worldwide law enforcement to find and arrest Kwon.\nInterpol:\nRed Notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.\n\nEarlier this month, South Korea issued a warrant for the arrest of Kwon and five other individuals, and prosecutors believed they were all in Singapore as recently as September 14th. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office had asked Interpol to issue the red notice, saying that Kwon was “obviously on the run and has no intention to appear before us for questioning,” the Financial Times reported last Monday.\nKwon has publicly maintained that he isn’t trying to escape. On September 17th, Kwon tweeted that “I am not ‘on the run’ or anything similar.” Earlier this afternoon, after not tweeting for more than a week, he appeared on Twitter again, saying that he is “making zero effort to hide.” Given Interpol’s red notice, perhaps Kwon is trickier to find than he might be letting on.\nInterpol’s press office said the organization does not comment on specific cases or individuals and that the “majority” of red notices aren’t made public. You can see which notices are public on Interpol’s website. Terraform Labs didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

However, I pulled out of the queue after seeing how long others were having to wait near its launch. Now, after seeing time and time again that Valve has increased production of the Deck to shorten wait times, it eventually made me rejoin the queue, if only as an experiment to see how quickly I could get to the front of the line.\nAs it turns out, I only had to wait a month. I placed a deposit for the $529 256GB model on August 25th, and I just received my email confirmation that it was available for purchase. That wasn’t so bad. With a wait this short, there’s no reason to pay higher-than-retail costs for a Deck through sites like StockX or Craigslist unless you’re truly desperate.\nValve originally expected that some reservations wouldn’t be fulfilled until Q4 2022 or later, though the company is now confident that it will meet all of that demand by the end of 2022. That’s remarkable progress, especially since it recently expanded reservations to more regions, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. All the while, it’s been improving the Deck’s software and game compatibility.\nSo, if you’re thinking of gifting a Steam Deck to yourself or to some lucky person in your life for the holidays, putting down the required $5 deposit at this Steam page should give you a month (if not a little less time) to count up all of your pennies to make sure you have enough.",

Elsewhere at Tudum, Netflix revealed new details on The Witcher season 3 and the prequel Blood Origin and showed off clips from Enola Holmes 2, Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery, Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, and They Cloned Tyrone.",

To say that the trailer makes it seem like the show might be something of a banger would be an understatement.\nLike Naughty Dog’s games, HBO’s The Last of Us from co-showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann tells the story of Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey), two people living in a world devastated by the outbreak of a deadly fungus that mutates those it infects into horrific monsters. Rather than focusing on the monsters themselves, The Last of Us’ trailer instead puts more energy into spotlighting just how much of its first season will feature Joel and Ellie keeping their wits about them as the world around them continues to go to hell. \nBased just on the handful of shots in the trailer, it’s difficult to say how The Last of Us will stack up to other zombie genre franchises built on the idea of zooming in on human drama during the apocalypse. But if the show ends up being anywhere near as unnerving and haunting as the games, HBO’s take on The Last of Us might be appointment watching when it hits HBO in 2023.",

The Call Links feature will start to appear on WhatsApp this week and can be accessed through a banner located at the top of the Calls tab. WhatsApp users who want to try the Call Link feature will need the latest version of the app.\nMark Zuckerberg announced the feature on Facebook, saying that WhatsApp users will be able to share a link to a call with “a single tap.” The ability to share a call link with up to 32 users was teased back in April during the announcement of another upcoming feature, WhatsApp Communities. \n\n\n\n\nThe Call Links feature will support both audio and video calls, and Zuckerberg also confirmed that encrypted video calling is currently being tested for group calls with up to 32 people, which is notable, as WhatsApp currently caps video calls at eight users. \nExpanded call capacity sets up WhatsApp as a competitor for the likes of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. These rival offerings have a far greater caller capacity (100 for Google and Microsoft Teams and 300 for Zoom). However, they include restrictions like call duration for free accounts and might not be the first choice for the billions of people already chatting on WhatsApp. WhatsApp didn’t mention any restrictions on call duration, which could place it as one of the best free video calling applications for smaller teams and personal networks once the feature is widely available.",

But even when Lubman gets praise on videos that get half a million views — for her songwriting, for her humor — she is realistic about how fickle TikTok can be.\n“I appreciate those comments a ton,” Lubman said. “But there’s a really good chance you won’t see another video from me for months because your TikTok algorithm is going to just show you other things and you’re gonna forget about me.”\nOn paper, it should be a golden age for music.

Previously, people could manually place people on one side of their family as they learned more about their matches.

This marks the first time Apple has shifted production from China to India this quickly after the launch of a new iPhone.\nAs noted by TechCrunch, Apple’s using Foxconn’s facilities in Sriperumbudur, India, to produce the device. While Apple has produced its flagship iPhones in India in the past, it’s typically done so well after the phone’s initial launch. The company only just started making the iPhone 13 in India in April, and it’s done the same with other models of the iPhone, including the iPhone 12 and 11. \nWe first heard that Apple planned on closing the gap between the time it takes to switch production from China to India back in August, with Apple initially hoping to finish making the first iPhones in India in late October. A source familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Apple and Foxconn managed to smooth over supply chain issues, allowing Apple to move production to India faster.\n“We’re excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. Apple didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.\nApple first started making iPhones in India in 2017 with the goal of decreasing the company’s reliance on China due to growing conflicts with the US. It also makes the devices more appealing to the Indian market, as locally producing the devices in India can make them more affordable in the country. According to TechCrunch, the standard iPhone 14 currently costs 79,900 rupees (about $980) in India, as opposed to the $799 price tag in the US.\nOther companies, like Google, appear to be considering manufacturing hubs outside of China as well. Google is reportedly planning on shifting the production of its Pixel smartphone to India or Vietnam. Samsung has been making devices in the country since 2007 and opened up the world’s largest phone factory in India in 2018.",

For the past two weekends in a row, subscribers have struggled to get their streams to work, and this weekend is no exception.\nEven before today’s games started, users began complaining about numerous issues, with many saying that they can’t log into their accounts on the Sunday Ticket website or app and others having problems loading the streams. Those who are able to access the stream are reporting quality issues.\nSomehow Sunday Ticket is acting worse than last week. Truly depressing. @DIRECTV\n— Alex Reno (@alex_reno) September 25, 2022\n\n\n\nDirecTV hasn’t issued any statement about whether it’s working to fix the stream, and the company didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment. In a response to one user’s issue on Twitter, DirecTV said “we know some customers can’t access NFL Sunday Ticket online or through the app” and that its “teams are working to resolve this.” Aside from DirecTV, users trying to stream football through CBS on Paramount Plus are also reporting problems.\nIn what will probably come as a relief to football fans, DirecTV’s rights to NFL Sunday Ticket expire at the end of this football season. This leaves room for another company to snap up the rights to Sunday Ticket, with Apple, Amazon, Disney, and Google reportedly looking to air Sunday Ticket on each of their respective streaming services. \nSo far, Amazon Prime Video’s showing of Thursday Night Football has shown some promise. The streamer’s first-ever live football game performed a heck of a ton better than DirecTV for the past few weeks, even with some minor blips here and there.",

But the real threat everyone’s facing in They Cloned Tyrone’s first trailer is a bit more hidden and insidious because it’s the sort of thing few people would be inclined to believe.\nThey Cloned Tyrone tells the story of Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris), Slick (Jamie Foxx), and Fontaine (John Boyega), three unlikely friends who are brought together by their shared discovery of a massive, secret governmental surveillance plan to monitor the lives of Black people before disappearing them and replacing them with clones. It’s hard to tell from They Cloned Tyrone’s trailer just what the end goal of snatching folks up is, or how three conspiracy theorists are supposed to take down that sort of operation on their own.

Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case, and there’s going to be a bit of a wait, but not an especially long one.\nWhile there was no new footage from The Witcher’s third season shown at this year’s Tudum presentation, Cavill and co-stars Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan a made brief appearances to share some teaser art and to announce that the series will return in 2023. \nTaken at face value, there isn’t all that much to glean from the teaser art, which features the wolf, swallow, and obsidian star symbols associated with Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefir in Netflix’s adaptation of The Witcher. But the way Geralt’s wolf medallion — a powerful magic tool — is broken in the art could be a nod to how Geralt’s original medallion is destroyed in The Tower of the Swallow, the fourth novel in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher Saga. \nNetflix’s series, CD Projekt Red’s video games, and Sapkowski’s novels are all very different beasts.

          "description": "Guillermo del Toro taking a peek at a miniature set featuring Pinocchio sleeping or not yet alive in Geppetto’s workshop. | Netflix\n    \n\n  \nOnce upon a time, it seemed as if Netflix’s upcoming stop-motion Pinocchio from co-directors Guillermo del Toro and Mark Gustafson’s might in a bit of competition with Disney’s “live-action” spin on the classic story from Robert Zeemckis. But that all changed when del Toro stopped by Netflix’s annual Tudum event to give everyone a closer look into the labor-intensive, mesmerizing, and magical process that brought his Pinocchio to life.\nIn the new video, which features a number of different Pinocchio scenes in the midst of production, del Toro opens up a bit about what all he wanted to bring to his take on the fairytale, and why he insisted that the bulk of its animation was done by hand. \nWhile there’s also quite a bit of digital production involved in the film’s making, del Toro explained how the minute imperfections that come with hand-made stop motion art have a way of making stories like this feel more magical because they give you a sense of how the overall process works.\n“I really wanted this movie to land in a way that had the expressiveness and the material nature of a handmade piece of animation — an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,” del Toro explains. “But it had the sophistication of movement that research in rigs and puppetry-making have taken us.”\n Pinocchio is set to hit Netflix on December 9th.",

A mix of bad water management policies and manmade climate change has created a situation where water supplies in Western reservoirs are so low, states are being forced to cut their water use. \nIt’s not hard to find media coverage that focuses on the excesses of residential water use: long showers, swimming pools, lawn watering, at-home car washes. Or in the business sector, like irrigating golf courses or pumping water into hotel fountains in Las Vegas. \nBut when a team of researchers looked at water use in the West, they uncovered a very different story about where most Western water goes. Only 14 percent of all water consumption in the Western US goes to residential, commercial, and industrial water use. So who’s really using up the water? Their findings may hold the solution to dwindling water supplies in the West. \n\n\nYou can find this video and more on Vox’s YouTube Channel.",

Traditionally, initiative order takes the form of a list that moves from top to bottom, activating player characters and enemies along the way, then resetting at the “top of the order” on the next turn.\nBut traditional initiative order can be a little boring.

The studio purchased another Helsinki-based studio called Next Games earlier this year, and previously acquired Oxenfree developer Night School Studio and Boss Fight Entertainment.\nThe streaming service features a growing catalogue of games that subscribers can play at no additional cost with no ads on iOS and Android devices. Some highlights include the charming animated platformer Poinpy and Before Your Eyes, which you can literally play by blinking.

Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure will premiere on the streaming service later this year, on Dec. 13.\nGudetama’s new Japanese-language Netflix series mixes real actors with CG. The trailer sees Gudetama team up with a tiny chick, Shakipiyo, on an adventure to find their mother — although Gudetama is obviously reluctant to do anything at all. \nThe central conflict seems to be that Gudetama is reaching their expiration date and “going bad.” One of the human characters also vows to catch Gudetama, so it seems as if the lazy egg and Shakipiyo will spend some of their time on the run from humans.\nYuko Hara of the Southern All Stars will sing the Gudetama March theme song for the series.\nFor the uninitiated, Gudetama is a kawaii Japanese anime character created by Sanrio — the same company behind Hello Kitty. They’re an egg yolk with a constantly distressed face and what’s often referred to as “depression,” due to the modern world. They’re like if Winnie the Pooh’s Eeyore was a bright yellow egg instead of a stuffed donkey.\nThe show’s IMDB page suggests Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure’s first season will run for ten episodes.",

With a few exceptions — like those who play the children of Lord Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint), who are each portrayed by three sets of actors throughout the season — Rhaenyra and Alicent are the only two main cast members to swap performers after the time jump. This has made the mid-season decade leap forward feel unusually weighty — and for the most part, House of the Dragon does not make a big deal of it. \nThis is in keeping with es…",

Martin and showrunner Ryan Condal reaped storytelling philosophy from Netflix’s The Crown. Peter Morgan, creator of that series, knew it was impossible to linearly chart every beat of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign (RIP), so from the first season, the drama bounced from significant moment to significant moment, with each hour playing like a stand-alone film.\nHouse of the Dragon’s time jumps make Martin…",

The Indian team has had four captains in T20s this year with Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant leading the side. Post the win, Rohit shared a few pictures on social media and captioned it as, \"CHARACTER 🇮�🇳�.\" India will next face South Africa in a three-match T20I series, beginning on September 28, 2022.",
