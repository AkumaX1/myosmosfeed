Today, Peloton announced another partnership with Dick’s Sporting Goods to sell its equipment both online and exclusively in its stores across the US. The partnership marks the first time that its equipment will be readily available for purchase in a third-party retailer’s brick-and-mortar store. \nThe move to expand its fitness lineup to physical stores beyond the ones Peloton operates isn’t surprising. It’s continuing a plan to improve operations after a disastrous last 18 months that included layoffs, replacing founder and CEO John Foley with a new CEO, and restructuring. Last month, CEO Barry McCarthy announced another round of layoffs and said Peloton will shut down its in-house retail locations in 2023.\n\n\nPeloton senior VP Jen Parker said in a press release, “This partnership is a natural fit for our brand and our Member acquisition goals ... Retail remains a critical touchpoint, and we want to provide the in-store experience that many current and prospective Members still covet.” \nIn a Q4 earnings report in August, Peloton noted a decline in its membership numbers, a $1.2 billion operating loss, and a 28 percent drop in revenue compared to the same period a year before. \nWith this new partnership, current and potential Peloton customers can buy the Peloton Bike, Bike Plus, Tread, Guide, and select accessories. The company said orders made online on Dick’s website will also have home delivery and setup, while “select” orders made in-store can be carried out. There isn’t much information on Peloton or Dick’s website except a list showing some of its over 100 stores in the US that will be included in the rollout, scheduled to start ahead of the holiday season.",

In a blog post on Thursday, the company announced that it’s updating its video player to be “immersive” — tapping on it will make the video full screen, and if you scroll up, you’ll “start browsing more engaging video content.” The company is also adding a video carousel to its Explore tab, which will show you “some of the most popular videos being shared on Twitter.”\nThe company says its “immersive media viewer” will start to roll out in the iOS Twitter app over the next few days and that the videos on the Explore tab are “currently available to people in select countries” who are using iOS or Android. Both updates are coming to people using the app in English first.\nImage: Twitter\n      The Explore tab will now have a section dedicated to videos.\n  \nWhile Twitter doesn’t seem to be going all in on copying TikTok like Instagram has, it’s definitely a big change; until this point, videos have mostly been treated as parts of tweets. (Though the somewhat annoying floating livestream player acted as its own thing in certain situations.) Now, they’re becoming their own separate experience; it wouldn’t surprise me at all if we end up getting a dedicated video tab soon, where you’ll automatically be given a starting video to begin your scrolling. The company’s post does say that it wants to make Twitter “the best place for video,” after all.\nWhile TikTok is still a huge deal, social media companies haven’t always found success copying it. For every YouTube Shorts, there’s a yanked Instagram redesign that turned even photo posts into a full-screen scrolling experience, sparking backlash from some of the biggest users on the platform.",

And that self-selection is okay with me.”\n\n\nAsked about today’s meeting, Meta spokesperson Dave Arnold declined to comment but pointed toward comments from Zuckerberg during the last Meta earnings call, where he said, “Our plan is to steadily reduce headcount growth over the next year. Many teams are going to shrink so we can shift energy to other areas.”",

You can hear the difference between the old voices and the updated voices for yourself through prerecorded snippets on the Android Developers Blog. \nFrankly, while the voices do sound clearer, I’m skeptical about the claims it sounds more natural. It’s also still difficult to ascertain what the first sentence in these US English-language recordings actually says — is this my gun? Is this my god?

The current default voice in “English-US” is changing to one built using “fresher speaker data,” which, alongside other updates, results in a recognizable improvement from the previous default voice. You can also listen to how the updated voices sound in languages such as “Spanish-US” and “Brazilian-Portuguese.” \nThe update announcement says that folks already using text-to-speech tech don’t need to do anything to receive the new voices, as “everything will happen behind the scenes” with the updates being downloaded automatically. Its listing on the Google Play Store states that the service is already used by a variety of native applications such as Google Maps, Google Translate, and the Android Recorder app, so chances are that if you use an Android device, you probably already use the Speech Services by Google speech engine even if you don’t know it. The update is rolling out over the next few weeks to all 64-bit Android devices via the Google Play Store.",

But the studio did reveal some of the cast, including Owen Teague (Black Mirror and the newer It films), Freya Allen (The Witcher), and Peter Macon (The Orville). The screenplay comes courtesy a team that includes Josh Friedman (War of the Worlds), Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), and Patrick Aison (Prey).\nIt’s not clear how exactly you’ll be able to watch Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. 20th Century says the movie will be out in 2024 but doesn’t specify a theatrical release, and franchise films from the studio like the Predator spinoff Prey have been released directly on Hulu.",

It’s a way to easily separate a subject from a background and quickly share the results or paste them into applications. What would usually take considerable time and effort when using photo editing software can be done with a couple of easy steps in iOS 16. It’s surprisingly good, and you can easily share the results with your group chat for maximum entertainment. Here’s how it works.\nI followed these steps on both an iPhone 11 running iOS 16.0.2 and an iPhone 14 Pro running iOS 16.1 developer beta three.\nOpen Apple’s Photos app.\nFind a picture in your camera roll with a subject that you want to isolate and cut out, like a person, pet, or a prominently featured object.\nLong press on the subject until you feel a haptic buzz and see a white border appear, identifying your subject.\nFrom here, tap either Copy or Share.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n      Cats are ideal subjects for this kind of feature.\n  \n\n  \n        \n      You can copy your cutout or share it directly.\n  \n\n\nIf you copy the image, you can paste it anywhere that allows you to paste a PNG image file, like Google search, Messages, or even a note. If you tap Share, you’ll see options to AirDrop it, save the image to your camera roll, assign it to a contact, or add it to a new Quick Note, among others.\nEssentially, that’s it! For a little more guidance on getting the best results, here are a few tips:\nAny image saved to your camera roll is fair game — it doesn’t have to be taken with your iPhone.\nIt works best with people, pets, or clearly defined objects.\nIf you long press an image and nothing happens, try again by pressing a different part of the image. If multiple attempts fail, then it probably is just not a good candidate for image cutout.",

Google will be refunding all Stadia hardware purchased through the Google Store as well as all the games and add-on content purchased from the Stadia store. Google expects those refunds will be completed in mid-January.\n“A few years ago, we also launched a consumer gaming service, Stadia,” Stadia vice president and GM Phil Harrison said in a blog post. “And while Stadia’s approach to streaming games for consumers was built on a strong technology foundation, it hasn’t gained the traction with users that we expected so we’ve made the difficult decision to begin winding down our Stadia streaming service.” Employees on the Stadia team will be distributed to other parts of the company. \nHarrison says Google sees opportunities to apply Stadia’s technology to other parts of Google, like YouTube, Google Play, and its AR efforts, and the company also plans to “make it available to our industry partners, which aligns with where we see the future of gaming headed,” he wrote.\nThe writing has been on the wall for Stadia for a while now, most recently when Logitech announced its new cloud gaming handheld last week and Stadia was one of the few cloud gaming services not mentioned. But Stadia has been facing rumors of its demise practically from the start. Google has a habit of killing projects only a few years after they launch, and Stadia, a cloud gaming service from a company with few ties in the gaming industry, seemed like a prime candidate for an early demise.\nLast year, rumors abounded it would shut down after the number of games released to the platform slowed and the company shuttered its in-house game development studios. When those rumors popped up again this year, Google insisted that Stadia was not shutting down. “Rest assured we’re always working bringing more great games to the platform and Stadia Pro,” the company said in a tweet. Which was true... until today.",

The South Korean tech giant says it’ll be available in October for $2,999. Alongside it, the company has also announced pricing for the massive 97-inch version of its G2 OLED TV, which costs $24,999 and is available now, as well as the LG OLED Posé (LX1) lifestyle TV, which costs $1,999 for the 55-inch model that’s available now or $1,699 for the 48-inch model coming in November.\nConsidering the exorbitant $100,000 price tag LG slapped on its rollable TV last year, $2,999 for a bendable TV almost sounds affordable.

          "description": "Photo by Edward Smith / Getty Images\n    \n\n  \nMental health technology company Headspace Health is calling for researchers to submit proposals for studies on the impact of the company’s tools. The company’s products include both the meditation app Headspace and the digital therapy platform Ginger. \n“We see meditation as both a practice rooted in ancient history and a topic of modern science — which is why we’re just as dedicated to studying it as we are to sharing it with the world,” the company wrote on its “Science at Headspace” webpage. \nIn the statement about the program, Headspace Health noted that research has already found benefits for mental health of both the meditation app and the therapy platform. But there’s still a lot that experts don’t know about mental health apps generally — like how they work and who they work best for. Many mental health companies don’t direct research scrutiny at their products at all. \nInterest and use of digital mental health products skyrocketed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and demand for traditional mental health services (like in-person therapy) still outpaces supply. Digital products can also be more accessible to people looking for support. They can be cheaper for people who don’t have insurance, and many (like Headspace and Ginger) are offered by employers or included in insurance plans. That makes it even more important to closely evaluate these tools and check if they’re actually giving people the support that they promise. \nResearchers interested in using Headspace as part of a study can submit their proposals through an online form. And if they’re not accepted, they’re out of luck — the app’s terms of service say that people cannot use it for any type of research or evaluation “without the express written consent of Headspace.”",

Sackboy: A Big Adventure is set to release on PC on October 27th, according to a trailer that was posted early to Sony’s PlayStation Latin America YouTube account. Spotted by Nibel on Twitter, the trailer confirms the PC port of Sackboy: A Big Adventure will be full of improvements.\n4K and 120fps support is listed, alongside support for ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio monitors, Nvidia’s DLSS, and Variable Refresh Rate (VRR). These are the best improvements to Sackboy: A Big Adventure yet, following a resolution and visuals boost on the PS5 version.\nSackboy is the latest in a line of PlayStation games on PC\nSackboy: A Big Adventure is the latest in a growing line of PlayStation exclusive games on PC. Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered launched on PC last month, after Horizon Zero Dawn, Days Gone, and God of War appeared in recent years. Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection is also launching on PC on October 19th, with Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales arriving on PC at some point this fall.\nSony has been increasingly focused on PlayStation PC ports, and wants around half of its games to be on PC and mobile by 2025. Sony even started using a PlayStation PC label last year alongside acquiring a PC port developer.\nThe announcement of Sackboy: A Big Adventure on PC comes just a day after a PC version of the Returnal settings menu leaked. Sony confirmed its authenticity by copyright striking the video on YouTube, but the settings video showed support for ray-traced shadows and reflections, and Nvidia’s DLSS. Sony might also be working on its own PlayStation PC launcher, as references to the launcher were discovered in the recent release of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC.",

Points will be able to be redeemed for things like PSN funds and certain PlayStation Store items. The collectibles will include things like digital versions of characters and devices from PlayStation’s history, and you’ll be able to display them in a case in the PlayStation app.\nSome of the collectibles will be “ultra-rare”; while it’s unclear exactly what it will take to get those, Sony’s blog post says that being the first to get a platinum trophy in certain games as one Stars campaign that’s in the works. But the company stresses that the collectibles are not one of a kind, do not “leverage blockchain technology,” and can’t be resold or traded, so these won’t be PlayStation NFTs, thank goodness. \nPlayStation Stars is beginning to roll out now in Asia (including Japan) and will launch in Europe and Australia on October 13th.",

With Channels, you can subscribe to streaming services using your information and payment details linked to your Apple ID and manage those services from your Apple ID account instead of trying to remember a bunch of disparate logins. Plus Play seems to be Verizon’s take on a similar idea, but instead, you manage things via your Verizon account. Verizon has already said that partners like Netflix, Peloton, Disney Plus, and HBO Max are on board, and now we can count the NFL among them.\nThat said, Plus Play still isn’t widely available yet, so if you really wanted to manage your NFL Plus through the platform, you probably can’t.

It will still be available if you’ve already downloaded SwiftKey on your iPhone, so long as you don’t uninstall it yourself.\n“Microsoft will continue support for SwiftKey Android as well as the underlying technology that powers the Windows touch keyboard,” Chris Wolfe, the director of product management at SwiftKey, said in a statement to The Verge. “For those customers who have SwiftKey installed on iOS, it will continue to work until it is manually uninstalled or a user gets a new device.”\nThe move to discontinue SwiftKey on iOS comes after months of user complaints that seemingly went unresolved. On top of that, users noticed that Microsoft hasn’t updated the SwiftKey app on iOS in over a year, prompting suspicion over whether the app had been quietly discontinued. \nIt remains unclear why Microsoft has decided to end support on iPhones. SwiftKey has been available on iOS since 2014, two years before Microsoft acquired the app. SwiftKey will still remain available and fully supported on Android, and Microsoft continues to roll out regular updates. Last year, SwiftKey brought clipboard syncing across Windows and Android devices that use the app but said it’s “not possible to sync your clips to iOS” at the time — and now we know why.",

Sounds like a great time to learn how to use a new feature on your phone, right? Hell no, and it seems that Apple has come to the same conclusion. Sleuths at 9to5Mac discovered some code in the latest iOS 16 developer beta that hints at the existence of a satellite SOS demo mode, potentially so you can get familiar with the feature before you get into trouble.\nSOS via satellite is the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro-only feature Apple announced (and demo’d for us) earlier this month. It uses satellite connectivity to help relay messages and location info to emergency services when you’re out of cell range. It’s not live yet; the feature is expected to arrive in November. \n\n\nIn the meantime, Apple seems to be laying the groundwork for its official launch. 9to5Mac found “multiple features” in iOS 16.1 developer beta 3 related to satellite connectivity, but the demo mode stands out as something we hadn’t heard about before. This satellite demo seems like a legitimate walkthrough, too, that requires you to go outside and find a clear view of the sky to use it. 9to5Mac reports that it will be available anytime from the settings menu.\nApple is far from alone in pursuing ways to connect phones to satellites, but it’s still a very new concept to most people. A demo mode could help iPhone 14 owners get familiar with the feature and how it works — or maybe help convince them that it’s worth paying for. Apple will include two years of service on the iPhone 14, but after that, it’s unclear how much it will cost.",

          "description": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nSince the start of the pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration has signed off on 430 COVID-19 tests through its emergency use authorization powers — rules that let the agency push tests and drugs out the door more quickly during an emergency. Now, over two years later, the agency is backing off that system and will treat most COVID-19 tests just like other medical tests. In a statement Tuesday, the FDA said that most new COVID-19 tests will have to go through the normal, non-emergency test review process. \n“For most new tests, shifting to traditional premarket review would best meet the public health needs at the current stage of the COVID-19 public health emergency,” said Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in the statement.\nThe emergency use authorization system lets the FDA review and authorize tests quickly, which was key during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when there weren’t nearly enough tests available to meet skyrocketing demand. It’s how we got the original tests that used deep nasal swabs to find the coronavirus, and it’s how all of the rapid at-home tests made it to drug store shelves. But now, there are plenty of COVID-19 tests available, the FDA said in its statement. There isn’t as much of a crush, so the agency can take more time reviewing new tests and give them full, formal approval. \nThe United States is still under a federal public health emergency, so the FDA can still use the emergency use authorization process if it feels it needs to. In the statement, the agency said it will still use that process in a few cases — like for tests that use new technologies, or for tests that diagnose a new variant.\nBut for other COVID-19 tests, the process will go back to normal. It’s another signal that federal agencies are shifting to make COVID-19 part of the normal public health backdrop, rather than an acute emergency.",

          "description": "A rendering of the Tesla Bot.  | Image: Tesla\n    \n\n  \nThis Friday, Elon Musk is expected to unveil a prototype of his Optimus robot — better known as the Tesla Bot. When Musk announced last August that Tesla was developing a general-purpose robot capable of handling “unsafe, repetitive or boring” tasks, the reaction from experts was skeptical. A year on and not much has changed, with roboticists telling The Verge that we’re a long way off building a robot that can outright replace human labor.\nThat doesn’t mean, though, that they’re not excited to see what Tesla has come up with. \n“We still have fundamental robotics technology gaps that need to be solved before we will see ‘human level’ anything,” Will Jackson, CEO of robotics company Engineered Arts, tells The Verge.

In his own statements, Tariq echoed the studio’s sentiments about their working relationship having been a good one and expressed his eagerness “to see where the next director takes the film.”\nDetails about the new Blade have been surprisingly sparse since the project was first announced to much fanfare back at San Diego Comic-Con in 2019, and it wasn’t until last year’s Eternals that the studio began teasing out how the daywalking vampire might pop up in the MCU. While it’s always notable when a director dips out of a movie like this, it also isn’t all that uncommon or surprising given how far out from their actual production start dates these things are always announced. In the same way that the new Fantastic Four movie found Matt Shakman to direct after Jon Watts’ exit, it won’t be long before someone steps up to the plate and gets ahold of Blade, which is still slated to hit theaters on November 3rd, 2023.",

          "description": "Earlier this month, EA announced that it was partnering with Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force on a Monster Hunter-style action game. Today, the companies finally showed off the first trailer for the title, which has been dubbed Wild Hearts (not to be confused with the excellent indie game Sayonara Wild Hearts). It’s described as “an epic adventure set in a fantasy world inspired by feudal Japan,” and the first footage shows gameplay that looks faster than Monster Hunter, with inventive traps, sweeping locales, and some truly vicious beasts. The game will be playable solo or via “seamless co-op.”\nHere’s the basic premise, per EA:\nWild Hearts takes place in Azuma, a fantasy landscape inspired by feudal Japan, that is now rampaged by the once peaceful Kemono — altering their environment at the cost of citizens’ lives. The Kemono range from plant-infused squirrels to the massive Kingtusk wild boar. After a dreadful fight with the winter wolf Deathstalker, players become bearers of a life-sustaining technology and are compelled to restore balance across the region. \n\nThe fact that EA is entering the hunting genre is no surprise, given the success of Monster Hunter World. First released in 2018, the more open-ended take on the long-running series went on to become the best-selling release in Capcom’s history, selling more than 18 million copies across multiplatforms. (And it’s on top by a large margin: Capcom’s second best-selling game is Resident Evil 7, with 11 million units.) To date, though, there has been little in the way of competition to MonHun’s unique style of action.\nWhile Omega Force is best known for the Dynasty Warriors franchise, the studio has steadily expanded into creating spinoffs for some of the biggest franchises in gaming, including The Legend of Zelda and Fire Emblem.\nWild Hearts is launching on February 17th, 2023, on the PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.",

Jackman’s reprisal is of particular note given how Deadpool 3 will be the franchise’s first film following Disney’s acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2017, which brought all of the X-Men IP (which includes both Wolverine and Deadpool) back to Marvel Studios. While there was initially some concern as to whether the Deadpool franchise would keep its hard edge after becoming part of the MCU, Kevin Feige’s said that Marvel intends to keep the mutant mercenary in R-rated territory. \nHard keeping my mouth sewn shut about this one. ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/OdV7JmAkEu\n— Ryan Reynolds (@VancityReynolds) September 27, 2022\n\n\n\nLogan, the last movie to feature Wolverine, was similarly darker and more mature than any of Fox’s previous X-Men movies featuring Jackman as the character, and it makes a certain amount of sense that he’ll return on a similar note. Of course, this, certain parts of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, and Ms. Marvel all beg the question of just what Marvel Studios is planning to do with the rest of the X-Men characters who’ve yet to pop up in the MCU. But with Marvel’s current phase of films drawing near its end, it feels safe to assume that folks with x-factors are a big part of the studio’s plays for the near future.\nDeadpool 3 does not yet have a release date.",

The first version of this spring sale will take place from March 16th to March 23rd.\n“The addition of a Spring Sale was a popular request from our developer and publisher community,” Valve says in a blog post about the news. “It will allow us to create more space between our four major seasonal sales and provide more opportunities throughout the year for developers to expand and execute their discounting calendar.” \nNow there’s a big Steam sale for every season\nAs for why it is discontinuing the Lunar New Year sale, which typically took place in late January or early February, Valve said it received feedback that the sale was too close to the “December holiday sale period.” That said, Valve expects that some publishers will still discount their games around the Lunar New Year in the future.\nWith this new spring sale, there will now be a major Steam sale for each season, and Valve has already shared the dates for its upcoming autumn and winter sales. The autumn sale will take place from November 22nd to November 29th, while the winter sale will happen from December 22nd to January 5th.",

But I’m legitimately impressed with the latest update to its Nintendo Switch Online app for iOS and Android. Paid subscribers can now add Splatoon 3-specific widgets to their phone or tablet homescreen. \nVersion 2.3.0 of the app for either platform adds the ability to use three new widgets: a photo album to see the pictures that you’ve snapped from the game, your battle log to show your recent wins and losses, and finally — my favorite — a stage schedule that fills you in on the upcoming stage rotation for various game modes. That one also shows what gear you have equipped and what abilities that gear has.\nIf you can’t get enough Splatoon 3 (I represented Team Gear, winner of the most recent Splatfest — just sayin’), using these widgets is a good way to constantly be tapped into your obsession. Each of the widgets is a different size (and can be modified slightly), so organize your homescreen accordingly.\nHere’s how the new widgets look on my Android phone homescreen.\n  \nIt’s ironic and kind of great that Splatoon 3 brought about this forward-thinking online integration out of Nintendo. Compared to previous installments, this game’s online modes are much easier to join and play with friends, and this update is further evidence that Nintendo is more serious than ever before about online. Though, I still haven’t forgotten about that convoluted voice chat solution it devised for Splatoon 2.",

If you’re a fan of high-stakes business dramas, this one seems as though it will check a lot of the boxes; the trailer has glimpses of dramatic boardroom scenes, swanky parties, and even congressional testimony.\nThat said, if you’re looking for a completely accurate story about the rise of Spotify, this isn’t going to be it. While the trailer says this series is based on “6 untold stories,” Netflix spells out that the show is a “fictionalized account.” I’m guessing that means the creators will be playing a bit fast and loose with the historical facts in service of making something fit for a television series. To be clear, I think that’s a totally fine thing to do! Just don’t expect this to be a documentary. The series is inspired by Spotify Untold, a book about Spotify by two Swedish business reporters, according to Variety.\nThe Playlist, which will be a six-episode series, debuts on Netflix on October 13th.

Sky Stream launches on October 18th, and it means you can connect a puck to any TV and get Sky TV content over Wi-Fi or ethernet.\nThe Sky Stream device will plug into a pocket socket and a TV’s HDMI input, and it only requires a minimum speed of 10Mbps broadband. It’s capable of streaming HD as standard, but you can also add 4K and HDR streaming add-ons. It’s the latest move in Sky’s ambitious effort to move away from the satellite dishes that have defined its TV service for decades. \nImage: Sky\n      A Sky Stream device in a living room.\n  \nPricing will start at £29 per month for a 31-day rolling contract that can be canceled at any time or £26 per month for an 18-month plan. The puck itself is essentially £39.95, as you’re paying a “setup fee,” or it’s £20 if you take out an 18-month contract. The basic package will provide access to Sky’s base offering of TV channels, and there are add-ons like Sky Cinema, Sky Sports, BT Sports, and 4K support that cost extra. You can also pick a whole home pack upgrade that lets you add up to five extra Sky Stream devices for £12 per month. \nSky Stream will include the ability to restart live TV, but you won’t get the recording options found on Sky Q boxes that come with hard drive storage. Given so much content is available on demand in the UK now, that might not be a problem for most people seeking an alternative to satellite dish installation.",

For one, remember that you must log in with your PlayStation Network ID to buy a PlayStation 5 from Sony, so make sure you have your username and password ready.

According to South Korean publication Yonhap and The New York Times, South Korean prosecutors said that Interpol has issued a “red notice” asking for help from worldwide law enforcement to find and arrest Kwon.\nInterpol:\nRed Notices are issued for fugitives wanted either for prosecution or to serve a sentence. A Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action.\n\nEarlier this month, South Korea issued a warrant for the arrest of Kwon and five other individuals, and prosecutors believed they were all in Singapore as recently as September 14th. The Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office had asked Interpol to issue the red notice, saying that Kwon was “obviously on the run and has no intention to appear before us for questioning,” the Financial Times reported last Monday.\nKwon has publicly maintained that he isn’t trying to escape. On September 17th, Kwon tweeted that “I am not ‘on the run’ or anything similar.” Earlier this afternoon, after not tweeting for more than a week, he appeared on Twitter again, saying that he is “making zero effort to hide.” Given Interpol’s red notice, perhaps Kwon is trickier to find than he might be letting on.\nInterpol’s press office said the organization does not comment on specific cases or individuals and that the “majority” of red notices aren’t made public.

          "description": "Even for the midrange 256GB model, the time to wait after placing a reservation is pretty short. | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nI was one of the people who rushed to put down a deposit for Valve’s Steam Deck the first moment that I could. However, I pulled out of the queue after seeing how long others were having to wait near its launch. Now, after seeing time and time again that Valve has increased production of the Deck to shorten wait times, it eventually made me rejoin the queue, if only as an experiment to see how quickly I could get to the front of the line.\nAs it turns out, I only had to wait a month. I placed a deposit for the $529 256GB model on August 25th, and I just received my email confirmation that it was available for purchase. That wasn’t so bad. With a wait this short, there’s no reason to pay higher-than-retail costs for a Deck through sites like StockX or Craigslist unless you’re truly desperate.\nValve originally expected that some reservations wouldn’t be fulfilled until Q4 2022 or later, though the company is now confident that it will meet all of that demand by the end of 2022. That’s remarkable progress, especially since it recently expanded reservations to more regions, including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. All the while, it’s been improving the Deck’s software and game compatibility.\nSo, if you’re thinking of gifting a Steam Deck to yourself or to some lucky person in your life for the holidays, putting down the required $5 deposit at this Steam page should give you a month (if not a little less time) to count up all of your pennies to make sure you have enough.",

To say that the trailer makes it seem like the show might be something of a banger would be an understatement.\nLike Naughty Dog’s games, HBO’s The Last of Us from co-showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann tells the story of Joel (Pascal) and Ellie (Ramsey), two people living in a world devastated by the outbreak of a deadly fungus that mutates those it infects into horrific monsters. Rather than focusing on the monsters themselves, The Last of Us’ trailer instead puts more energy into spotlighting just how much of its first season will feature Joel and Ellie keeping their wits about them as the world around them continues to go to hell. \nBased just on the handful of shots in the trailer, it’s difficult to say how The Last of Us will stack up to other zombie genre franchises built on the idea of zooming in on human drama during the apocalypse. But if the show ends up being anywhere near as unnerving and haunting as the games, HBO’s take on The Last of Us might be appointment watching when it hits HBO in 2023.",

The Call Links feature will start to appear on WhatsApp this week and can be accessed through a banner located at the top of the Calls tab. WhatsApp users who want to try the Call Link feature will need the latest version of the app.\nMark Zuckerberg announced the feature on Facebook, saying that WhatsApp users will be able to share a link to a call with “a single tap.” The ability to share a call link with up to 32 users was teased back in April during the announcement of another upcoming feature, WhatsApp Communities. \n\n\n\n\nThe Call Links feature will support both audio and video calls, and Zuckerberg also confirmed that encrypted video calling is currently being tested for group calls with up to 32 people, which is notable, as WhatsApp currently caps video calls at eight users. \nExpanded call capacity sets up WhatsApp as a competitor for the likes of Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom. These rival offerings have a far greater caller capacity (100 for Google and Microsoft Teams and 300 for Zoom). However, they include restrictions like call duration for free accounts and might not be the first choice for the billions of people already chatting on WhatsApp. WhatsApp didn’t mention any restrictions on call duration, which could place it as one of the best free video calling applications for smaller teams and personal networks once the feature is widely available.",

          "description": "Illustration by Samar Haddad / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nErica Lubman, an indie artist who goes by the moniker Boy Jr., is objectively good at TikTok. She has amassed more than 300,000 followers with her tongue-in-cheek songs and videos spoofing indie rock culture. Those followers have translated into ticket sales for live shows and millions of streams. But even when Lubman gets praise on videos that get half a million views — for her songwriting, for her humor — she is realistic about how fickle TikTok can be.\n“I appreciate those comments a ton,” Lubman said. “But there’s a really good chance you won’t see another video from me for months because your TikTok algorithm is going to just show you other things and you’re gonna forget about me.”\nOn paper, it should be a golden age for music. Anyone with a song in their heart and a subscription to TuneCore can distribute their music on Spotify and other music streamers right alongside Beyoncé. And plenty are taking advantage of it — nearly 75,000 new songs are uploaded every day. So why, as research firm Luminate reported earlier this year, are consumers listening to less new music than before?\n\n\nIn part two of The Vergecast’s series on the future of music, I try to find out why it is so hard for new artists to break out. Speaking with industry experts, I explore the past 25 years of music streaming: from early warnings of the “celestial jukebox” to my personal golden age of music, the MySpace era, to the current boom and bust cycles of streaming today.",

The new feature, launching this week, builds on the SideView technology the company announced in April. \n“We’re really excited to see what users can do with this parental matches feature,” says  Caitlyn Bruns, a population geneticist at Ancestry. “I do think it will really help unlock an understanding of how you’re connected with your matches.”\nThe feature will let users more easily see where matches fall on their family tree. Previously, people could manually place people on one side of their family as they learned more about their matches. Now, it’ll happen automatically. \nThe SideView technology leverages Ancestry’s enormous DNA database to sort which parts of a person’s genome came from each parent. When it first launched, it let users see which parts of their ethnicity came from each parent. Ancestry says SideView can have 95 percent precision for 90 percent of customers. \nNext, Ancestry plans to extend SideView to its communities feature, which connects people to groups of other users who might have descended from people who lived in the same area as their ancestors, Bruns says. It’ll group those communities by parental side. \nOnce it goes live, this new DNA match feature will be available to users automatically when they log in to their account. \n“This is just something that we’re really excited about that that we can do with the size of our database and not something that other people are able to do at this point,” Bruns says.",

          "description": "Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nApple has started assembling the iPhone 14 in India, according to reports from TechCrunch and Bloomberg. This marks the first time Apple has shifted production from China to India this quickly after the launch of a new iPhone.\nAs noted by TechCrunch, Apple’s using Foxconn’s facilities in Sriperumbudur, India, to produce the device. While Apple has produced its flagship iPhones in India in the past, it’s typically done so well after the phone’s initial launch. The company only just started making the iPhone 13 in India in April, and it’s done the same with other models of the iPhone, including the iPhone 12 and 11. \nWe first heard that Apple planned on closing the gap between the time it takes to switch production from China to India back in August, with Apple initially hoping to finish making the first iPhones in India in late October. A source familiar with the situation told Bloomberg that Apple and Foxconn managed to smooth over supply chain issues, allowing Apple to move production to India faster.\n“We’re excited to be manufacturing iPhone 14 in India,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. Apple didn’t immediately respond to The Verge’s request for comment.\nApple first started making iPhones in India in 2017 with the goal of decreasing the company’s reliance on China due to growing conflicts with the US. It also makes the devices more appealing to the Indian market, as locally producing the devices in India can make them more affordable in the country. According to TechCrunch, the standard iPhone 14 currently costs 79,900 rupees (about $980) in India, as opposed to the $799 price tag in the US.\nOther companies, like Google, appear to be considering manufacturing hubs outside of China as well. Google is reportedly planning on shifting the production of its Pixel smartphone to India or Vietnam. Samsung has been making devices in the country since 2007 and opened up the world’s largest phone factory in India in 2018.",

The Bills had a chance to run one more play to win the game, but the team ultimately ran out of time, losing to the Dolphins 19-21.

The company reportedly paid more than $400 million for two sequels to Rian Johnson’s original whodunit, and Glass Onion also features a star-studded cast including the likes of Janelle Monáe, Leslie Odom Jr., David Bautista, Jessica Henwick, Kathryn Hahn, Kate Hudson, and Edward Norton, alongside star Daniel Craig.\nKnives Out is just one of several cinematic universes that Netflix is hoping to turn into its next big film franchise.\nGlass Onion starts streaming on Netflix on December 23rd, and will be in select theaters before that. In the meantime, you can check out our spoiler-free review.",

At its Tudum event today, Netflix announced that the supernatural thriller Oxenfree, which first launched in 2016, is now playable through its fledgling games service. The Netflix version of Oxenfree is available as a free download to Netflix subscribers on both iOS and Android, and features subtitle support for more than 30 languages.\nNetflix has steadily been adding excellent games like Into the Breach, Before Your Eyes, and Lucky Luna to its mobile gaming offerings, but Oxenfree is particularly notable because Netflix acquired its developer, Night School Studio, last year. Oxenfree also feels like a good fit for Netflix, with its focus on storytelling and a vibe that’ll appeal to Stranger Things fans. A sequel is also in the works.\n\n\nElsewhere, Netflix announced two games that will be launching on September 27th: Spongebob: Get Cooking and Desta: The Memories Between, which is developed by Monument Valley studio Ustwo. Other games listed as “coming soon” include a mobile version of the acclaimed Kentucky Route Zero and a baking game based on the Netflix series Nailed It.\nNetflix started its foray into gaming late last year, though early reports suggest that it hasn’t caught on with the majority of subscribers yet.",

          "description": "Freya Allan as Ciri. | Netflix\n    \n\n  \nWhen Netflix announced during last year’s Tudum that a third season of The Witcher was already on the way, there was some hope that maybe, just maybe Henry Cavill’s Geralt of Rivia would be back on our screens slaying demons in time for the upcoming holiday season. Unfortunately, that’s not going to be the case, and there’s going to be a bit of a wait, but not an especially long one.\nWhile there was no new footage from The Witcher’s third season shown at this year’s Tudum presentation, Cavill and co-stars Anya Chalotra, and Freya Allan a made brief appearances to share some teaser art and to announce that the series will return in 2023. \nTaken at face value, there isn’t all that much to glean from the teaser art, which features the wolf, swallow, and obsidian star symbols associated with Geralt, Ciri, and Yennefir in Netflix’s adaptation of The Witcher. But the way Geralt’s wolf medallion — a powerful magic tool — is broken in the art could be a nod to how Geralt’s original medallion is destroyed in The Tower of the Swallow, the fourth novel in Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher Saga. \nNetflix’s series, CD Projekt Red’s video games, and Sapkowski’s novels are all very different beasts. But it wouldn’t at all be surprising to see a rather major moment from the source material becoming one of The WItcher’s big season 3 plot points when it returns some time next summer.",

But that all changed when del Toro stopped by Netflix’s annual Tudum event to give everyone a closer look into the labor-intensive, mesmerizing, and magical process that brought his Pinocchio to life.\nIn the new video, which features a number of different Pinocchio scenes in the midst of production, del Toro opens up a bit about what all he wanted to bring to his take on the fairytale, and why he insisted that the bulk of its animation was done by hand. \nWhile there’s also quite a bit of digital production involved in the film’s making, del Toro explained how the minute imperfections that come with hand-made stop motion art have a way of making stories like this feel more magical because they give you a sense of how the overall process works.\n“I really wanted this movie to land in a way that had the expressiveness and the material nature of a handmade piece of animation — an artisanal, beautiful exercise in carving, painting, sculpting,” del Toro explains. “But it had the sophistication of movement that research in rigs and puppetry-making have taken us.”\n Pinocchio is set to hit Netflix on December 9th.",

          "description": "The Commonwealth, explained.\n After centuries of colonizing much of the world, the British Empire began its fast descent in the 1960s amid a global wave of independence movements. But when Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she was not only still queen of 14 countries besides the United Kingdom; she was also still the leader of an organization that, on a map, looks a lot like the British Empire.\nThe British Empire created the first iteration of the Commonwealth to appease white settler colonies looking for more autonomy. It granted them more independence to govern themselves but kept them under the crown. As British leaders realized their power might be at risk throughout their colonies worldwide, the monarchy made a play to keep ties and preserve their global influence by allowing newly independent republics to join the Commonwealth, too. The only catch: They had to accept the queen as the leader of the organization. With her death, this vestige of the British Empire is now under the leadership of King Charles III. So what exactly is the Commonwealth? Why is it still here? And will it survive?\nYou can find this video and more on Vox’s YouTube Channel.",

A mix of bad water management policies and manmade climate change has created a situation where water supplies in Western reservoirs are so low, states are being forced to cut their water use. \nIt’s not hard to find media coverage that focuses on the excesses of residential water use: long showers, swimming pools, lawn watering, at-home car washes. Or in the business sector, like irrigating golf courses or pumping water into hotel fountains in Las Vegas. \nBut when a team of researchers looked at water use in the West, they uncovered a very different story about where most Western water goes. Only 14 percent of all water consumption in the Western US goes to residential, commercial, and industrial water use. So who’s really using up the water? Their findings may hold the solution to dwindling water supplies in the West. \n\n\nYou can find this video and more on Vox’s YouTube Channel.",

In other words, if you’re a Stadia user, you’ll effectively be unable to play any Stadia games you own. But hey, at least you can get a refund!\nIt’s been a rocky three years for Stadia, which Google first rolled out in 2019 to a mix of intrigue and skepticism. Stadia purported to revolutionize the way we play games, allowing players to stream major video games without need of a console or high-end PC.

But after the release of Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team, the community was primed for another miniature skirmish game, this time set in the fantasy world of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar. The appeal was similar — a meaty game that only requires a handful of miniatures to play, and a system with the potential for strong narrative campaigns and a bustling competitive scene. The result was a hit with both fans and critics alike. Warcry: Heart of Ghur is the second Warcry box set, released to retail in August, and it marks a simple yet effective revision of what was already Games Workshop’s best ruleset.\n…",

But Sheeran and Pokémon’s bond is evolving with the release of “Celestial,” a new song that not only features Pokémon in its official video, but will also appear in Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet.\nSheeran released the “Celestial” music video on Thursday — after teasing it underneath a blanket of Pokémon plush toys two weeks ago — and it raises the question of whether he is OK. In “Celestial,” Sheeran is plagued by Pokémon hallucinations: He has a fry up with Charmander, who helps him make food for all his imaginary Pokémon pals; he’s nearly hit by a London cab, but is spared death by a Snorlax; and after being struck by songwriting inspiration, he hitches a ride home from Charizard. From there, Sheeran goes full anime, and seemingly dies in an explosion caused by Mew and Mewtwo battling.\nFortunately for Sheeran and fans of modern radio-friendly rock, it was all a dream. Or was it the work of Hypno?! Who can say! Regardless, the “Celestial” video is cute, thanks to the inclusion of all those adorable Pokémon and the contribution of illustrator Yu Nagaba — a frequent collaborator of The Pokémon Company — who handled the cartoonish side of Sheeran’s latest project.\nSheeran’s the latest in a long line of pop stars who have rubbed elbows with Pikachu and crew in recent years, including Katy Perry, Post Malone, J Balvin, and Vince Staples, all of whom appeared on last year’s Pokémon 25: The Album.\nPokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet are headed to Nintendo Switch on Nov. 18.",

And if you don’t recognize October’s titles, well, you’re not alone.\nNext month, Games With Gold will be giving out Windbound, which Polygon called a “Moana-meets-Breath-of-the-Wild survival adventure,” when it was announced (and launched) in 2020. \nThe second game is Bomber Crew: Deluxe Edition which, despite its cutesy-poo characters and generic box art, is actually something different and substantive. We previewed the game in 2017; in the strategy simulation, players try to keep a World War II bomber flying (and its crew alive) through hell and back. In each harrowing raid, players get to know the personal histories of their crew — more incentive to keep them all alive. If nothing else, you can imagine you’re aboard a B-17 with Kevin Costner and Keifer Sutherland, in Steven Spielberg’s unforgettable Amazing Stories episode from 1985.\nBoth Windbound and Bomber Crew: Deluxe Edition are Xbox One titles, playable on Xbox Series X. Windbound is available Oct. 1 to Oct. 31; Bomber Crew is available Oct. 16 to Nov. 15.\nIn addition to these games, subscribers can still get three of September’s Games With Gold: Gods Will Fall, for Xbox One, and Portal 2 for Xbox 360, until Sept. 30; and Double Kick Heroes for Xbox One until Oct. 15.",

In addition to sweeping quests across its massive map, the game also lets you decorate buildings, plants, landmarks and more, in a separate realm called the Serenitea Pot (also known as the Realm Within). It’s a detailed decorating simulator, and a change introduced in the 3.1 patch made it even better by allowing players to overlap decorations. \nThe seemingly small change makes a big impact for fans who are super into decorating since it allows for more flexibility. Before this patch, items could not be placed closed together, and instead required a varying amounts of space as a buffer. To get around this, fans had to exploit a shaking glitch where they would wiggle around decorations before placing. The glitch would allow players to place the items within the radius of other decorations. Now, that’s no longer an issue, and players can decorate to their heart’s content. \n  @tikolatte \nShaking glitch is no more! #sereniteapot #genshinteleport #hoyoversecreators \n ♬ End Of Line but better - MothMom • Dingus \n  \n\nGenshin Impact has loads of different options for players — some people focus on exploration, others focus on building strong characters, and some focus almost exclusively on decorating their teapot.

Each pack comes with a few simple multiplayer games; players can join a Jackbox session using a browser on a computer or mobile device. These games are popular because they’re so easy to pick up and play with friends, and they make for excellent stream nights or social gatherings with pals. The Jackbox Party Pack 9 will be released on Oct. 20.\nThis pack comes with a sequel to a Jackbox classic, Fibbage 4. Fibbage, a game about suggesting fake trivia answers to puzzling questions, is one of the series’ most popular games. The pack also debuts four new games.\nQuixort, a game with up to ten players, tasks participants with sorting falling answers into the proper categories on a factory floor. Quixort has a single-player mode for those who like trivia and/or Tetris.\nJunktopia is for three to eight players, and it asks the players — who have been turned into frogs by a weird wizard — to create backstories for unusual, salvaged objects to be appraised for auction. The frog with the best backstories and most valuable items gets to be a human again. So, y’know, no pressure.\nIn Nonsensory, three to eight players have to come up with prompts in a drawing, writing, and guessing game. Players then rank each others’ creations on silly scales with subjective attributes.\nThe most elaborate-looking new game is Roomerang, a reality TV show with four to nine players. Contestants will respond to prompts and engage in role-play to avoid being voted out — although people who are booted can be Roomerang-ed back into the roster to stir up more nonsense.",

Rudeism, a streamer known for creating novelty controllers, has taken a crack at the ultimate Trombone Champ controller.\n\n\nHere, we can see the controller in action: It’s a peripheral of an actual, factual trombone, complete with slide capabilities and some hearty doots. It’s not great as hearing the trombone serving as a proper instrument, but it is the most immersive way to rack up some Trombone Champ high scores.\nBEHOLD, THE TROMBONE CONTROLLER\nUltrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a microphone controls the dooting.

An ultrasonic sensor controls the slide, and a built-in microphone captures his trumpet sounds. It’s absolutely beautiful. Rudeism has made a career out of gaming with these great peripherals, pulling off tricks like playing Rocket League with a guitar controller, playing as Overwatch’s French sniper Widowmaker with a controller baguette, and beating FromSoftware’s massive open world adventure Elden Ring with a Fisher Price controller.\nRudeism streams on Twitch, where you can catch his experimental stylings live.

The publisher says it will now launch March 9, 2023.\nUbisoft announced the delay on Wednesday; Skull & Bones had been slotted for a Nov. 8 launch on Amazon Luna, Google Stadia, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. \n“While the game development is finished at this stage, the extra time will be used to further polish and balance the experience using players’ feedback from our Technical tests and Insider Program which happened over the past two weeks,” Ubisoft said in a statement. “This is the right decision both for our players and for the long-term success of the game as March 9, 2023 provides for a suitable release window for this very unique new brand.”\nSkull & Bones was announced at E3 2017, but development on it may be traced back to 2013’s pirate-themed Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag. Originally given a late 2018 launch window, it has been delayed four times over the past four years.\n\n\nUbisoft Singapore, despite a lengthy project that Kotaku reported in 2021 had cost more than $120 million, appeared to turn a corner this summer when it hosted a one-hour gameplay reveal livestream and confirmed Nov. 8 as Skull & Bones’ launch date.\nSet in the Indian Ocean in the 17th century, on a map stretching from the east coast of Africa to Malaysia, Skull and Bones puts players in the role of a pirate captain seeking to make a name for themselves. Starting with a tiny ship and a spear, they’ll quickly work their way up to commanding larger vessels and crews, managing the ongoing threat of mutiny and finding enough food and plunder to placate everyone.",

Milestone’s racer isn’t necessarily a kart game — it employs strong racing physics as well as arcade-racing mechanisms like turbo boosts. It was a Polygon Recommends selection when it launched in September 2021.\nInjustice 2, for PS4, from Mortal Kombat maker NetherRealm Studios, launched in 2017 and is the sequel to the 2013 DC Universe fighting game Injustice: Gods Among Us. There was also a companion comic book series explaining the somewhat convoluted story that had Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all duking it out among one another.\nSuperhot, from the eponymous Superhot Team, began life in early 2016 as a puzzle/action game for Windows PC, quickly moving to Xbox One and Oculus virtual reality adaptations. In it, players control a stylized action hero who has to think his way through a bullet-time fight with numerous adversaries. In Superhot, time only moves when the player does, giving them plenty of opportunity to think about their next move in a John Wick-style badass sequence. The PlayStation 4 version of Superhot launched in 2017.\nPlayStation Plus subscribers can still pick up September’s Essential-level games — Need for Speed: Heat, Granblue Fantasy: Versus, and Toem — through Oct. 3.",

Wiglett is long, white, and loves hanging out on the beach.\nWiglett was revealed in a somewhat unusual fashion, as part of a faux Zoom call between members of the World Ecological Pokémon Society, which is being shown a presentation on the Paldean region by Jacq, the player’s homeroom teacher in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. During the video, various biomes and Paldean Pokémon are shown, including another newcomer, Paldean Wooper. Society members remark on Wiglett’s appearance, likening it to a region-specific version of Diglett — even though it is apparently a separate species.\nWhether Wiglett will evolve into another form — as Diglett does into Dugtrio — is unknown. You can watch the Wiglett reveal in this video uploaded by Serebii, if you don’t want to sit through the entire World Ecological Pokémon Society presentation. \nPokémon Scarlet and Violet will be released Nov. 18 for Nintendo Switch. The newest mainline game will introduce the ninth generation of Pokémon and the new Paldean region. Players will be able to catch brand-new Pokémon like Armarouge, Ceruledge, Klawf, Grafaiai, Fidough, Paldean Wooper (aka Pooper), Cetitan, Cyclizar, Smoliv, Lechonk, and Pawmi.

However, those with different musical sensibilities might not necessarily get that. That’s okay, because Metal: Hellsinger developer The Outsiders have released modding tools that allow savvy players to add basically whatever music they want.\nLike, for example, jazz.\nWe have Metal: Hellsinger. Now meet Jazz: Hellsinger.  \nUnleash Hell to YOUR beat. Custom music modding is now available on PC!\n  https://t.co/PEfXYJ0jmi pic.twitter.com/2rydrYyd5p\n— Metal: Hellsinger     OUT NOW! (@MetalHellsinger) September 27, 2022\n\n\n\nPer the game’s official website, players who have Metal: Hellsinger or its demo on PC can mod the game to work with any kind of music: K-Pop, EDM, hip-hop, or Kidz Bop. Given the nature of copyright enforcement, actually showing off those mods publicly might be tricky, but that just means folks will have to get even more creative. Imagine playing Metal: Hellsinger to the sultry tones of WTF with Marc Maron, or the outrageous stories on Normal Gossip. You already listen to podcasts while gaming, why not combine the two?",

There’s usually some kind of gimmick that sends customers on scavenger hunts in the hopes that they will buy more in exchange for digital goodies.

Interactive Entertainment via YouTube\n    \n\n  \nRick Sanchez also joins the game’s roster\n MultiVersus has a new update that’s set to bring a few changes to the game. Beta patch 1.03 adds Rick Sanchez to the game as its newest fighter, makes a few balance tweaks, and most importantly significantly increases the amount of experience players need to hit level 15 with every character. \nAccording to the patch notes from developer Player First Games, the XP requirements for progressing from level 3 to level 15 have been doubled. The developer says that it’s making the change because it felt that players were progressing through the levels too quickly, and it wanted to “make it a bit more of a journey.” \nThe only problem is, despite increasing the time it takes to earn these levels, Player First Games didn’t increase the rewards that players get for progressing. So it’s more work for the exact same reward. \nOther than this slightly frustrating adjustment, the patch also brings in the game’s latest character with Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty, and a new anti-infinite combo system that should help prevent players from getting caught in enemy combos that chain the same move together too many times in a row. \nMultiVersus patch 1.03 will arrive after the game’s maintenance, which should end around 1 p.m. ET. For a look at all of the changes in the latest MultiVersus patch you can check out the full patch notes.",

          "description": "Image: Prime Video\n    \n\n  \nYes, really, that’s Mount Doom\n Middle-earth has plenty of famous mountains, from the peaks of the Misty Mountains to Erebor, but perhaps the most important to the story is Mount Doom, the volcano at the center of Sauron’s evil domain of Mordor. In the latest episode of Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, we got a surprising and explosive origin story for the series’ most famous volcano.\n[Ed. note: The story contains spoilers for The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power episode 6.]\nTo answer the most obvious question first, yes, that was in fact Mount Doom that erupted at the end of the episode. In case you, like Galadriel, are terrible at remembering what Middle-earth looks like on a map, the Southlands of The Rings of Power, where the besieged village of Ostirith sits, also happens to be the land that will later become Mordor. \nIt seems that the evolution of the land from lush fields and beautiful mountains was part of a grand design by either Morgoth or Sauron and was triggered by the sword-key, releasing a massive flood. This flood destroyed the land, thanks to the tunnels the orcs had already dug, and triggered an eruption of the volcanic Mount Doom (though in the show’s time it doesn’t have that name yet) until it erupted. This eruption spewed molten rock and magma in a miles-wide radius that it appears will remain scorched forever, or at least until Frodo, Sam, and Gollum arrive there with the One Ring.\nWhile the history of Mount Doom isn’t very explicit in Tolkien’s lore, the show’s story does seem to mostly line up. We know that the land wasn’t always called Mordor, and that the name likely arrived after Mount Doom’s eruption, but there’s no mention of the eruption itself being caused by an intentional flood.\nAs for what will happen to the area next, and how long it will take before Sauron takes up residence there, we’ll just have to wait to see where The Rings of Power takes its story next.",

          "description": "Image: 20th Century Studios\n    \n\n  \nSorry humans, you had your time\n The recent Planet of the Apes trilogy is one of the most consistently fun and thoughtful blockbuster franchise revivals in recent memory. Beginning in an understated fashion with Rupert Wyatt’s 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the series took off when The Batman director Matt Reeves grabbed the baton for 2014’s Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and 2017’s War for the Planet of the Apes with an understated approach to post-apocalyptic action that never lost sight of the humanity in its story about a burgeoning ape society. \nTurns out their story is not over: Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, “an all-new chapter in the ‘Planet of the Apes’ saga” will enter production next month. According to 20th Century Studios, the story will pick up many years after the conclusion of War for the Planet of the Apes, but any plot details beyond that aren’t being revealed yet.\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes will star Owen Teague (It), Freya Allan (The Witcher), and Peter Macon (The Orville), and it will be directed by Wes Bell (known for the Maze Runner films but also the unfortunately canned animated adaptation of Mouse Guard). While this seems like a changing of the guard, two of the writers on the script — Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver — worked on the first two films, and they’re joined by Josh Friedman and Patrick Aison (the latter of which wrote the excellent Prey). \nUnfortunately, there’s no mention of the one thing that helped make the new Apes trilogy such a success: Weta Digital’s work bringing the Apes to life, which included an all-time great performance from Andy Serkis as the ape leader Caesar. That’s not to say the movie can’t be good with another team and performer, it’s just easily the biggest shoes to fill, the sort of thing that will help or hinder the storytelling ambitions of a movie like this. \nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is currently set to premiere in 2024.",

The film stars Chalamet as Lee, a young serial killer who falls in love with Maren (Taylor Russell), a runaway on the margins of society who shares Lee’s affinity for cannibalism.\nSet to Leonard Cohen’s song “You Want It Darker,” the trailer shows glimpses of Lee and Maren’s trek across Reagan-era America, with the pair driving through picturesque open plains and pouncing on any unsuspecting prey unfortunate enough to cross their path.\nThere are a surprising number of movies featuring cannibalism, from 2016’s Raw and 2013’s The Green Inferno to The Silence of the Lambs and The Neon Demon. Guadagnino’s film appears to be going the Natural Born Killers route, with Lee and Maren desperately attempting to maintain their relationship despite the obvious violence and emotional volatility rife at the crux of its foundations. We’ll just have to see how fate fares for these two lovers when the film opens in theaters.\nBones and All premieres in theaters on Nov. 23.",

          "description": "Image: CoMix Wave Films\n    \n\n  \nThe film will premiere in U.S. theaters in early 2023\n Makoto Shinkai, the acclaimed anime director behind such films as Your Name and Weathering With You, is returning this fall with a new movie about a young woman who falls in love with a chair. That’s essentially the elevator pitch for Suzume, but there’s a whole lot more going on in the new trailer for the upcoming film, which is slated to release in theaters in Japan this November.\nSet in the quiet town of Kyushu, the coming-of-age film follows the story of a 17 year-old girl who finds herself thrust into a magical adventure when she crosses paths with Souta, a mysterious and brooding stranger searching for a mystical door to another world. \nAfter confiding in Suzume that disaster will befall Japan if these are not closed, Souta is transformed into a sentient chair by a malevolent cat bent on plunging the world into chaos. In order to reverse the curse, Suzume and Souta must work together to track down the cat and close doors scattered across Japan along the way.\nAs outlandish as the premise might sound, the crux of the story feels very much in line with the rest of the director’s oeuvre. A persistent theme in one form or another across all of Shinkai’s films is the concept of missed connections, of people finding each other in spite of seemingly improbable circumstances, only for those connections to be stymied by equally improbable circumstances outside of their control. I’d say “being turned into a chair by an evil magical cat” falls squarely within the latter description.\nSuzume is set to open in theaters in Japan on Nov. 11. The film is set to release in U.S. theaters sometime in early 2023.",

The departure could complicate the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s packed schedule, which has Blade premiering Nov. 3, 2023.\nTariq confirmed to Variety he was out as director; but the trade also reported that Tariq is still attached to the project as executive producer. “Eager to see where the next director takes the film,” Tariq told Variety.\nBlade, a reboot of Wesley Snipes’ vampire-hunting cult hit from 1998, was revealed at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. It is slated to be part of the MCU’s “Phase 5,” announced at SDCC this past July. \n\n\nAlthough this film is part of the overall MCU, Blade is a key figure among the super-monsters subgenre that Marvel Comics spun up in several 1970s publications, including crossovers with The Amazing Spider-Man. The most recent screen adaptation from this line of heroes and villains was March’s poorly received (and non-MCU Sony Pictures adaptation) Morbius.\nThat said, Marvel Studios keeps its releases on a tight schedule and often teases or links them up narratively, in post-credits sequences or the films themselves. If Tariq leaving Blade as director delays the movie overall, it could affect other Phase 5 movies, like May 2023’s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 or The Marvels, planned for July 28, 2023.\nBlade made his first MCU appearance with actor Mahershala Ali’s voice-over in a post-credits sequence for 2021’s Eternals, in which Blade speaks to The Black Knight, Dane Whitman (played by Kit Harington).",

The film, made by the great Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon (Wolfwalkers), will be released on Nov. 11.\nMy Father’s Dragon is about a young boy called Elmer Elevator. Discomfited by a move to a new city, Elmer befriends a talking alley cat, who tells him about a baby dragon being kept captive on Wild Island. Elmer resolves to rescue the dragon — a plump thing, with blue and yellow candy stripes — and adventures to Wild Island, where he must outwit many cunning animals to reach his goal.\nIn the surreal 1948 book, written by Ruth Stiles Gannett and indelibly illustrated by her stepmother Ruth Chrisman Gannett, Elmer grows up to be the father of the book’s narrator — hence its title. Judging by the charming trailer, it seems Cartoon Saloon is keeping this conceit going with a voiceover framing device.\nThe film is directed by Cartoon Saloon co-founder Nora Twomey, who also directed two of studio’s best films — The Secret of Kells and The Breadwinner, both nominated for Oscars, and both featured in our list of the best animated movies of the 2010s. It could not have a better pedigree. The cast includes Jacob Tremblay (Room, Luca) as Elmer and Gaten Matarazzo (Stranger Things) as Boris the Dragon, as well as the likes of Dianne Wiest, Rita Moreno, Chris O’Dowd, Judy Greer, Alan Cumming, Whoopi Goldberg, and Ian McShane.\n\n  \n        \n      Image: Netflix\n  \n\n  \n        \n      Image: Netflix\n  \n\n  \n        \n      Image: Netflix\n  \n\n  \n        \n      Image: Netflix",

A behind-the-scenes look at the film, which arrives with the home video release, confirms as such. As a little teaser, Polygon can exclusively share a brief blooper reel, which mostly features two of the movies best characters, the duo Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry), pal-ing around when they should be doing stuff like hurting people.\nBullet Train is now available on VOD, and arrives on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD on October 18.",

The trailer sees Gudetama team up with a tiny chick, Shakipiyo, on an adventure to find their mother — although Gudetama is obviously reluctant to do anything at all. \nThe central conflict seems to be that Gudetama is reaching their expiration date and “going bad.” One of the human characters also vows to catch Gudetama, so it seems as if the lazy egg and Shakipiyo will spend some of their time on the run from humans.\nYuko Hara of the Southern All Stars will sing the Gudetama March theme song for the series.\nFor the uninitiated, Gudetama is a kawaii Japanese anime character created by Sanrio — the same company behind Hello Kitty. They’re an egg yolk with a constantly distressed face and what’s often referred to as “depression,” due to the modern world. They’re like if Winnie the Pooh’s Eeyore was a bright yellow egg instead of a stuffed donkey.\nThe show’s IMDB page suggests Gudetama: An Eggcellent Adventure’s first season will run for ten episodes.",

For one, two fan favorite characters make their first appearances: Ravkan prince Nikolai Lanstov, as played by The OA’s Patrick Gibson, appears in the first moments of the teaser talking to Alina; later on in the clip, Jack Wolfe appears as Wylan — the sixth member of the Six of Crows, though canonically in the timeline he hasn’t really met the others yet. Also appearing are ruthless mercenaries Tamar and Tolya, played by Anna Leong Brophy (Traces) and Lewis Tan (Mortal Kombat) respectively. \nOf course, we also see Jessie Mei Li as Alina Starkov, powerful Sun Summoner, and Ben Barnes as the ruthless, yet captivating Darkling — along with the shadowy Six of Crows characters and everyone else from the first season. \nThe second season of Shadow and Bone is expected to follow the events of the second book in the main trilogy, Storm and Siege. But like the first season of the show, the new batch of episodes will also incorporate characters not seen until later books in order to flesh out the storylines.",

Netflix released the first trailer for the sequel, due out this November, at the company’s Tudum fan event.\nAs it turns out, trying to establish yourself as a private investigator is particularly tough when you are (1) a girl, (2) a teenager, and (3) the younger sister of the esteemed Sherlock Holmes. But Enola’s luck changes when a young factory girl brings her a case — the girl’s sister has been missing for a week and it’s up to Enola to solve the case. \nEnola Holmes 2 finds Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown reprising her role as the charming Enola. Henry Cavill once again plays a particularly hunky iteration of Sherlock Holmes, with Helena Bonham Carter as the Holmes’ siblings eccentric mother (in the first movie, The Hunger Games’ Sam Claflin played stuffy eldest brother Mycroft, but it’s not clear if he’s returning for this one). Additionally, Louis Partridge returns as Viscount Tewkesbury, the missing young lord from the first movie who strikes up a friendship with Enola. \nEnola Holmes 2 hits Netflix on Nov. 4.",

A large number of its operatives have been arrested in nationwide raids on the group by the NIA and the ED under 'Operation Lotus'.  The government has said that overtly the group and its affiliates operate as a socio-economic, educational and political organization but in reality they have been pursuing a secret agenda to radicalize a particular section of the society. But how did the outfit that had its roots in the Kerala-based National Development Front which was formed in 1993 reach here? The crackdown against PFI has raised several questions over a possible countrywide ban. Watch the video to know more.",

Taking to social media, she penned an emotional retirement post expressing her gratitude towards everyone who was a part of her journey. \"To my cricket family and beyond. So, the day has finally arrived! Like every journey has an end, my cricket journey of over 20 years ends today as I announce my retirement from all forms Of cricket.

It has been exhilarating, thrilling to say the least adventurous. I have had the honour of donning the India jersey for over two decades and serving my country to the best of my abilities.
